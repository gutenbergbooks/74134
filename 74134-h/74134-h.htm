  <h2 class='c005'>SULLIVAN’S GREAT MARCH INTO THE INDIAN COUNTRY</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c010'><i>PREFACE</i></h3>

<p class='c011'>Two great flank attacks on the British forces were made by the
Americans during the war of the Revolution. One, in winter, against
Quebec, in 1775–76, failed nobly; the other, in summer, into the Iroquois
country, against Tories and Indians, in 1779, was superbly successful.
Yet while Montgomery and Arnold have had their meed of fame, but
scant and tardy justice has been done to Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twelve years’ residence in the lake country of the Empire State,
amid the scenes of the march that destroyed savagery and opened the forests
to civilization, has made its story a most fascinating study. After repeated
examination, on the ground, of the camps, battlefields, scenes of
bridge-building and road-making, of topographical and engineering difficulties,
of marchings and of rest, and even of feasting, along nearly the
whole of the routes of the main army and right wing, I have learned to
appreciate more the magnitude of Sullivan’s task and the completeness of
his successful enterprise. One can more readily understand why Congress
and Washington first ordered the campaign, and then realized the importance
and value of its victories and happy issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>Critical analysis and comparison of local legends, study of the mythology—that
grows around picturesque scenery and striking names as
naturally as moss on a damp stone—and, most of all, of the original
journals and documents of the men of 1779, have but added to the pleasure
of the narrator. A knowledge of the march of Sullivan’s Continentals in
1779 makes the landscape between Easton and the Genesee Valley glow,
kindling at once memory, imagination and patriotism.</p>

<p class='c009'>May art glorify history and the tablet, boulder, and memorial line
the pathway of the Revolutionary patriots with beacon lights of grateful
remembrance.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='c012'>CONGRESS VOTES TO CHASTISE</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>After the awful massacres at Wyoming and Cherry Valley in 1778,
Congress passed a vote on the 27th of February, 1779, authorizing
Washington to break the power of the Iroquois Indians by desolating
their country. Only thus could the American frontiers be protected
from Tories and Indians and the rear and flank attacks be stopped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Until the Revolutionary War the Iroquois had been friends of our
fathers against the French in Canada, with whom the Algonquin Indians
had acted as allies. How did it come to pass that the Iroquois turned to
be our enemies? Lifting up the hatchet and scalping knife against us,
they left at Cherry Valley, and Wyoming, great blood spots, and along
the frontier a line of fire and death. To answer this question, we must go
back more than a century and a half. At that time the North American
continent was divided between two quite different sorts of Indians, the Five
Nations of the Iroquois, who were united in a confederacy, and the much
more numerous Algonquins, who lived all around them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1609, two men, each representing a different civilization, penetrated
the inland waters of America. Henry Hudson, an English captain
in a Dutch ship and with a Dutch crew, sailed up the river that now bears
his name and made the friendly acquaintance of the tribes of Northern
New York. Samuel Champlain, from France, came down the lake that
bears his name, acting not only as friend, but as ally to the Algonquins,
who were ever at war with the Iroquois. The boundary line between
these two kinds of Indians was drawn at Rock Regio, in Lake Champlain,
near Burlington, Vermont.</p>

<p class='c009'>It happened at this time that hostile parties from the North and South
were out seeking each other. Dressed in bark armor, with bows and
arrows, and stone hatchets, they met in combat, not in ambush, but in the
open field. The Frenchmen, taking sides with the Algonquins, killed
several Iroquois with their firearms. Forthwith, vowing vengeance
against these white men who had interfered, the Indians of the South
resolved to seek Dutch aid. A few years later they appeared at Fort
Orange, near Albany, bringing their beaver and other skins in exchange
for arms and ammunition. Thus armed, they were able to go forth on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>equal terms with the Algonquins to the slaughter of the French and their
allies. With them the age of stone was over and the new era of iron and
gunpowder had come.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arendt Van Curler, whom the red men call “Corlaer,” a well-educated
Hollander, who lived in America from 1630 to 1667, was superintendent
of the Dutch settlement where Albany now stands and later became
the founder of the city of Schenectady. He saw at once the value of
a league of peace with the Iroquois. He traveled among them, learned
their language, won their friendship and held them ever faithful, first to
the Dutch, and then after 1664 to the English. “The covenant of Corlaer”
became with the Iroquois a holy sacrament, and the policy of all
English governors was to “brighten the silver chain” of mutual friendship.
Van Curler was drowned near Rock Regio in Lake Champlain in
1667. Sir William Johnson from 1738 to 1774 continued, expanded
and strengthened the work of Van Curler. On the other hand the Five
Nations became the Six Nations, when in 1722 the Tuscaroras, driven
from the Carolinas in 1713, were formally admitted into the confederacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a century and a half the Indian was a political factor in determining
the question whether the Anglo-Saxon or the Latin civilization
should dominate North America. This question was settled on the
heights of Quebec, in 1763, when England became mistress of the Continent.
During all this time the French were never able, in war or in
peace, by their money or other gifts, by threats or smiles, by political
envoys or religious emissaries, to break the “silver chain” or to shake the
loyalty of the Iroquois to English-speaking men. To this day the Indians
call the governor of New York “Corlaer,” and Queen Victoria,
their ruler, “Kora Kowa,” or the Great Corlaer.</p>

<p class='c009'>When, under King George, the colonists in America and the corrupt
British parliament and court quarreled and began war, Congress hoped to
keep the friendship or neutrality of the red men. In August, 1775, the
first conference and treaty was made at Albany. Later General Schuyler
was sent into the Mohawk Valley to treat with the Iroquois and met a
council of chiefs at German Flats. “This is a family quarrel,” he said,
“and we want you to keep out of it,” and the red men promised to do so.
General Herkimer also met a great gathering of warriors from the Six
Nations at Unadilla.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the other side, the British agents at Oswego tried to win over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>savages, and succeeded. The Tories and British were able to present
much more convincing arguments in the shape of abundance of rum,
hatchets, beads, mirrors and guns and powder. Moreover the Indian is
always a conservative. He holds fast to tradition. Hence he was most
deeply touched by the adroit appeal to “the covenant of Corlaer,” and,
being told that the Americans were “rebels,” he sided with the British.
The Iroquois expected, in making this new alliance, that King George
would govern all the whites, while they should conquer and rule
all the red men in North America. It was a great day when General
Burgoyne and his officers in their glittering uniforms confirmed with
splendid presents the decision of the Iroquois to side with the King.</p>

<p class='c009'>Active in the campaign of 1777, these confederate red men fought
with the Tories and British soldiers against the Americans, especially at
the battle of Oriskany. For a while they were broken and demoralized
by Burgoyne’s defeat at Saratoga, when the whole British army
surrendered.</p>

<p class='c009'>When in 1778, the red men were rallied by Brant, Butler, McDonald
and Sir John Johnson, they made the head of Seneca Lake, where Geneva
now stands, their headquarters. Here they planned to attack Wyoming,
a settlement, chiefly of Connecticut people, from which most of the able
bodied men were absent in Washington’s army, only old men, boys, women
and children being at home. After the battle and massacre of July 3
another skillfully planned attack on Cherry Valley in New York was
made, and on the 11th of October this settlement was reduced to ashes
and the people murdered or taken prisoners to Canada.</p>

<p class='c009'>These atrocities decided Congress and Washington to chastise the
savages, desolate their country and paralyze the activity of the Tories.
It was especially necessary to do this, because the British were encouraging
their white and red allies to make the great maize lands of Central
and Western New York a granary from which they could feed their very
mixed army, made up of English, Irish, Scotch, Welsh, Hessians, Canadians
and Iroquois, besides keeping up a continual fire in the rear upon the
American forces.</p>

<p class='c009'>But they had Washington, Sullivan, and the American riflemen to
reckon with.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c012'>ASSEMBLING FOR THE GREAT MARCH</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Whom should Washington select for so difficult and doubtful a task?
The chosen leader must make an expedition, as into a foreign country,
through the unmapped and unsurveyed wilderness of Western New York,
against a foe ever ready by wiles and cunning to ambuscade the invader.
It might be, as in many a dismal case before, that his men would be shot
by invisible marksmen. Who would dare to try to feed an army of
regular troops with no base of supplies? With the precedent of Braddock’s
failure and bloody Oriskany before him, who aspired to lead? It
is no wonder that when Gates was offered the command he declined it at
once, much to Washington’s vexation. The commander-in-chief then
summoned General Sullivan. This descendant of Irish heroes was born
at Durham, in New Hampshire, and grew up to be a stalwart American,
a vigorous and far-seeing patriot. Just as soon, in 1774, as Great Britain
forbade the importation of military stores to America, Sullivan knew
there would be war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Collecting a body of eager young men, he drilled them in military
tactics. In December, 1774, he attacked Fort William and Mary, at
Newcastle, at the mouth of the Piscataqua river, and took the place
in daylight. In spite of the fire of the garrison, he entered without losing
a man, and pulled down the British flag. This was the first hostile act
of the kind in the war of the Revolution. He carried the cannon and
powder to Durham, where it was stored partly in a barn and partly in the
cellar of the Congregational church edifice, on the site of which the
monument reared to his honor now stands. The powder reached Bunker
Hill in time to fill the horns of the militia. Indeed, this was about the only
supply that our men behind the breastworks and rail fence had. Sullivan
commanded at Boston and on Long Island, and fought at Trenton,
Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown and in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to this time, 1779, the French Alliance had not amounted to anything,
and there were but fifteen thousand regular Continental soldiers
fit for duty. Yet so important did Washington consider this expedition
to destroy the Iroquois power that he detached one-third of his whole
force, or 5000 picked Continentals. In its organization the army of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>chastisement consisted of four brigades, a regiment of artillery and eight
companies of riflemen, making about five thousand men, with about two
thousand pack horses and twenty-five hundred cattle and two fleets of
boats for river service, with stores and ammunition. The New Hampshire
brigade, then encamped at Redding, Conn., and the New Jersey
brigade at Elizabeth, N. J., with the Pennsylvania regiments, were
ordered to march to Easton, and thence to move on to Wyoming, from
which point the stores and cannon were to follow the army until they
should reach Tioga Point, where is now Athens. Here they were to be
joined by the New York brigade from Schenectady.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Chemung and the Susquehanna, flowing from the east and the
west out of the heart of the Indian country, approach very near to each
other at Tioga Point, enclosing a pretty peninsula shaped like an arrow
head. Further down they meet and unite in one stream, the lordly Susquehanna,
on which canoes could reach the cities on the Chesapeake Bay
or any of the rivers flowing into it. Tioga Point was the Southern Door
of the Long House of the Iroquois confederacy, and here, as a base of
supplies, a diamond-shaped fort with a block house at each corner, with
hospital and barracks, was to be built. Upon this the army could fall
back in case of defeat, and here be re-victualed on their return march.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the rivers, nature provided the only highways, though the Iroquois
during centuries of war, trade and travel had made many trails.
From Tioga Point the Continentals were to march up the Chemung
Valley and thence into the wonderfully fertile lake country of Central
New York. Along the ridge overlooking Seneca Lake they would pass,
in order to strike the Tory headquarters and center of supplies at the
lake’s northern end, where then stood a big Indian village, and now not
far away is the city of Geneva. Thence westwardly they were to move to
Canandaigua and along the great trail at the southern end of the smaller
lakes, Canadice, Hemlock and Conesus, into the valley of the Genesee.
Possibly they might be able to reach the British fort at Niagara.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, in the great virgin wilderness of Central and Western New
York there was no other way of advance, save through the river valleys
and along Indian trails. When leaving the former and advancing
through the forests, it would be necessary for the axemen to chop their
way. In miry places the pioneers must cut down trees, lay the logs and
make corduroy roads. Swamps must be filled and the smaller streams
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>bridged. In many parts of the country to be traversed there were indeed
large open spaces where the cornfields of the Indians furnished stores
of food, while their gardens yielded, as our men discovered, twelve kinds
of vegetables. Yet in the main, the army would have to march through a
country covered with timber and brush wood.</p>

<p class='c009'>A large force of axemen, pioneers, surveyors and road-makers would
be necessary, especially as the artillery must be carried along, for Washington,
being himself a backwoodsman and an Indian fighter, knew the
persuasive power of cannon with the Indians. Brave as the painted
warriors undoubtedly were, they preferred fighting behind logs and trees
under cover. They objected, most decidedly, to stand up in ranks and
coolly keep their places in the presence of howitzers that could tear them
to pieces, not only by a frontal attack, but by sending shells to burst among
and behind them. The Indian had physical stamina, but he lacked moral
courage. Washington knowing this, ordered Colonel Proctor to take
nine pieces of artillery and his regiment of three hundred artillerists.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the guns, two were howitzers of five and a half inch caliber that
could throw bombs, two were six, and four were three pounders. Then
there was a Coehorn mortar, so light that it could be borne by four men.
This diminutive implement of war proved to be very effective, being
usually posted in the advance and easily carried over hill and valley.
Mounted on an iron frame, with hickory legs, it could easily be “laid” or
aimed at any angle. After a discharge it always kicked itself over, and,
because of its long spindle-like limbs, the soldiers called it “the grasshopper.”
Along with Proctor’s (now the Second United States) Artillery
went “a band of music,” that is, a fife and drum corps. In all,
there were about two hundred musicians with their drum and fife majors.
The lively tunes, such as “The White Cockade,” “The Tall Grenadier,”
and “Derry Down,” greatly inspirited our men, while at the solemn
burials in the forest, “Roslin Castle” was the usual dirge.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each regiment had its chaplain, and until the advance from Tioga
Point in battle array there were frequent services for worship and preaching
at the camps.</p>

<p class='c009'>Washington’s plan was to have a right and a left wing to the main
body. While Sullivan advanced through the Susquehanna country, Clinton’s
New Yorkers, with part of the Sixth Massachusetts, were to move up
the Mohawk river and valley with two field pieces and a fleet of two hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>boats. At Canajoharie he was to load his stores and boats on
wagons, each drawn by eight horses, and march over the hills to Otsego
Lake, thence to descend the outlet and enter the Susquehanna at Chenango
Point where Binghamton now stands. Floating past Owego, he was to
join Sullivan at Tioga Point, where the Chemung and Susquehanna unite.
This programme was very successfully carried out.</p>

<p class='c009'>The left wing, at Pittsburg, was led by Colonel Daniel Brodhead, a
Continental veteran, afterwards Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania. He
had assembled about six hundred men, including some friendly Delawares
and Cherokees, with one month’s provisions, and started August 11, transporting
his cattle and pack horses to Mahoning. Entering the country
of the Mingoes and the Muncey tribes in Western Pennsylvania, and the
Seneca towns in Southwestern New York, he desolated their houses and
corn fields.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The parings of scalps and the hair of our countrymen at every
warrior’s camp on the path,” wrote Colonel Brodhead to Washington,
“are new inducements to revenge.” Although his men on their return,
September 14, were bare-footed and in rags, and had had no pay for nine
months, he offered to lead an expedition to Detroit. Of two soldiers
whom he sent to General Sullivan, he heard nothing. “I apprehend,”
he wrote, “they have fallen into the enemy’s hands.” Dressing many
of his men like Indians, he sent out various parties that devastated the
region, and made it for a time uninhabitable by the savages. Very few
men on our side were lost, and not a soldier but these two fell into the
enemy’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although Brodhead’s “Allegheny expedition,” or “Diversion in
favor of General Sullivan’s expedition,” failed to make direct communication
with the main body of Continentals, yet his was a vital part of the
great expedition of 1779. It aided powerfully in that series of blows
which shattered the Iroquois confederacy. By keeping probably five
hundred Senecas from Sullivan’s front, Brodhead helped to toll the death
knell of savagery on the North American continent.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c012'>THE LONG HOUSE OF THE IROQUOIS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Indian country to be invaded by Sullivan stretched from the Hudson
to Niagara Falls, and was called by the Iroquois “The Long House.”
To this long house there were four “doors,” the northern at Oswego, the
southern at Tioga Point, the eastern at Schenectady, and the western at
Niagara.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1779 there were only a few settlements of the white man outside
of a thin line in the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys. The Six Nations of
Iroquois, the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas and Tuscaroras,
were federated together and usually acted as a whole. Many of
the Mohawks living near the settlements were friendly to the American
cause, and almost the entire Oneida tribe had been won over to loyalty
to the Continental Congress through the efforts of Dominie Kirkland,
afterwards a chaplain in Sullivan’s army and the founder of Hamilton
College. He was one of the few white men who had been as far west as
the great “castle” of the Senecas, on Seneca Lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Tuscaroras lived east of Cayuga Lake, the Cayugas between the
largest two of the “finger lakes,” Cayuga and Seneca. The Onondagas
dwelt around the lake which takes their name, and the Senecas, in the
region between the lake named after them and the Genesee river.
Roughly speaking, we may think of Schenectady, Utica, Syracuse, Elmira,
Geneva and Ithaca as being the centers of the six tribes mentioned in their
order, the central council-fire being with the Onondagas, near Syracuse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Senecas were, in 1779, the largest and most active of the tribes,
and “the Seneca country” was a general name for the great region which
Sullivan was to traverse. Our soldiers were to enter the Long House
through the southern door, at Tioga Point, near which, on the fertile
slope of the valley, was Esthertown, or the Indian Queen Esther’s country
and castle. One of their hardest marches would be through the swampy
valley stretching from the town of Chemung west of Esthertown to the
castle of Queen Catherine Montour, her sister, at Montour Falls, N. Y.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mention of Queen Esther’s name recalls the fact that the savages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>were not entirely alone in their schemes of hostility, but that the brain and
hands of white men assisted them in their bloody forays. Indeed, it was
one of the counts in the Declaration of Independence that the colonies
were justified in their war of independence, because George III. “has
endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless
Indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.” There were several hundred
white men aiding and abetting the Indians in the arts of war and
in methods of fortification. Besides the British regulars, Johnson’s
Greens, loyalists, Canadians and half-breeds, two of the most eminent
Iroquois women called “Queens” had white blood in their veins. Both
boasted descent from the French Count Frontenac, and were married to
powerful chiefs. Esther, at Sheshequin, near Tioga Point, and Catherine,
at Montour Falls, near the modern Watkins Glen, were the owners
of large and well-worked corn fields and of fenced gardens, of horses,
cattle, hogs, and other live stock and of houses made of sawed and carved
timber and spoken of as “palaces.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It must not be forgotten that from the missionaries of France, who
had at various times lived among the Indians for over a hundred years,
and from the traders, gunsmiths, and friendly whites of various disposition
and ability, supported by the British government, the Iroquois Indians had
reached a comparatively high point of progress. Even when the white
men first met them these federated warriors were the most advanced of
all others within the limits of the United States. They had their own
myths and legends. They met in council and had orators to argue both
sides of a question or proposal. They sent embassies from one tribe to
another, and these envoys were very ceremonious and careful in dress and
etiquette. When they made a treaty of peace they solemnly buried the
hatchet and smoked the calumet, or pipe of friendship. To dig up the
same weapon meant war. Instead of our letters, seals, and documents of
paper and parchment, they used wampum made of shells drilled and laced
together, which in belts or strings served as money, as messages, as historical
records. Some of the Indian orators, Logan, Red Jacket and others,
were very famous. To become such these men practiced elocution and
rhetoric very much the same as do our public speakers. As the Iroquois
raised and stored corn and other vegetable foods, they were able to wage
systematic war and go on long campaigns. Thus they excelled and conquered
the other savages. When they left the stone age, by obtaining
guns from Europeans, their lust of conquest was fired more than ever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>When the white men of Pennsylvania and Virginia paid the Indians for
lands, the avarice of the Iroquois was still further excited. Many tribes,
even as far as Canada and the Mississippi Valley, were vassals of the confederacy.
In the Iroquois we see the highest type of pagan man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our debt to the Indian is very great. He taught our fathers the use
of tobacco, maple sugar, corn, succotash and various methods of getting
food, besides the use of the birch bark canoe, the moccasin, and the snow
shoe.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Iroquois method of raising corn was very ingenious. On the
lands in river valleys this was easy enough, yet they could win crops even
in the forest. This they did by “girdling.” They cut round the tree
trunk near the ground, and again about ten feet higher, and then stripped
off the bark between the spaces girdled by the knife or hatchet. This
caused the tree to wither and the leaves to fall, quickly letting in the sunshine
on the ground. Thus, the Indian without the trouble of chopping
down the trees and clearing the land got at once the benefit of the soil.
In the autumn, by burning the underbrush and trees, the ground was enriched
and the space easily cleared for next year’s crop. In almost every
Iroquois village there were store houses made of bark or timber, in which
the grain was saved.</p>

<p class='c009'>The dwellings or long houses were made of wooden framework
covered with bark and built in the form of a modern compartment house.
Each had a long hall or passageway through the middle, with rooms on
either side, one for each family, with a fireplace in the center and the
sleeping bunks against the wall. The walls of these rooms were decorated
with bows and arrows, guns and equipments, and the prizes of
the chase, which all hunters love, and of war, over which warriors gloat.
They had also more horrible ornaments in the scalps of their enemies,
both white and red. These, stretched and dried on hoops, were often
painted and decorated with feathers and strings dyed in bright colors
which had symbolic significance.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of Sullivan’s soldiers, who enlisted hoping to rescue white
captives, often their own relatives, were able to recognize in the Iroquois
houses the hair and scalps of fathers, brothers, wives, children, neighbors
or friends. In the case of women, it was especially easy to do this.</p>

<p class='c009'>At several places where hill and ravine, or the situation of the rivers
and the inclosed land made natural fortresses, the Iroquois had “castles.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>These were made by driving three rows of young trees, sharpened at the
ends, into the ground to form a palisade which was fastened at the top.
Inside of these were platforms, on which warriors could stand and shoot
arrows or balls against besiegers. Besides barring the gate tightly, they
had heaps of stones ready to throw on the heads of near assailants and
tubs of water prepared to put out fires. It was expected that the artillery
would have to be used against these. The orders were to burn all the
Indian houses and utterly destroy the crops so that the country would be
left uninhabitable. There was no mistake about the orders of Washington
on this point.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the army was assembling and the stores, boats and horses were
in preparation, other expeditions on a smaller scale had been attempted.
The State of New York, in the autumn of 1778, attempted to send an
expedition among the Mohawks and Onondagas, but on account of the
lateness of the season it was abandoned. In the following year, however,
on April 19, Colonel Van Schaick leading, 558 men of the First New
York regiment made a forced march of 180 miles in six days against the
Onondagas. He burned three of their towns with their storehouses of
food, slew twelve and took prisoners thirty-three of the savages. With
the Onondagas was the hearthstone of the confederacy, and a terrible
humbling done to the Iroquois pride was the extinguishing of the council
fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pennsylvania was also active in clearing the path for Sullivan. In
September, 1778, Colonel Thomas Hartley with about two hundred
soldiers of the Eleventh Pennsylvania regiment, with seventeen horses,
advanced northward from Sunbury up the Lycoming river and into a
region of swamps, mountains, defiles and rocks. His especial object was
to destroy the power of Queen Esther. This squaw had made herself
very active in the massacre at Wyoming. She compelled the prisoners of
war to kneel in a circle around a boulder, still called “Queen Esther’s
Rock,” and tomahawked them one after another. This was in revenge
for her son killed in a skirmish. At Sheshequin, near Tioga Point,
Hartley destroyed, by the torch, her castle and everything else that could
be turned to ashes. Advancing up the Chemung Valley, towards Newtown,
the big Indian town on the flats, near modern Elmira, he found the
enemy in force and was obliged to return. On his way he cleverly defeated
the Indians and Tories who had tried to surround him. He and
his men waded or swam the Lycoming river no fewer than twenty times.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>He reached Sunbury again, October 5, having marched nearly three
hundred miles, capturing among other spoil fifty head of cattle and
twenty-eight canoes. In his various battles and skirmishes he lost four
men, but killed eleven of the enemy and took fifteen prisoners. His
regiment was reorganized and became “the new Eleventh regiment,”
under Colonel Adam Hubley, which formed part of Sullivan’s army and
ranked among his most effective troops.</p>

<p class='c009'>One has but to study the map of Eastern Pennsylvania, a region rich
in swamps, rocks, hills and mountain ranges, to see what difficulties awaited
the general who was to move a large body of troops, with artillery and
wagon trains, from Easton to Wyoming. To go up the Lehigh Valley
was impossible, for between its headwaters and the Susquehanna were
hills insurmountable. On the steel tracks of to-day a double force of
engine power is required. So from Easton, through the Blue Mountains
and Wind Gap, a road was cut through the forest, the stones taken out,
the boulders stacked, the miry hollows corduroyed and the swamps filled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Marvelous to relate, this military road, about seventy miles long, was
built within ten days. It was indeed one of the wonders of the Revolution.
Several hundred road builders, mostly Continental soldiers, under
Colonels Spencer and Van Cortlandt, did the work in parties, while
guarded by outlying scouts and riflemen. To-day the turnpike road and
the iron rails and bridges of the great railway companies traverse the
region in which “The Sullivan Road” once was, but the achievements of
the modern engineers are in no way more wonderful. In five days the
three brigades of Poor’s New Hampshire men, Hand’s Pennsylvania
Light Corps and Maxwell’s New Jerseymen, with Proctor’s artillery and
the wagon trains, made the march over the new road. Their camps were
at Wind Gap, Larner’s on the Pocono, “Chowder Camp,” near the Tobyhanna,
on the creek near the “Shades of Death,” and at “Great
Meadows,” or Bullock’s. Some of the relics of the road builders, including
the section of a tree carved with the camp name of “Hell’s Kitchen,”
are still preserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the building of the military road from Easton to Wyoming, and
through Hartley’s and Van Schaick’s raids, the enemy was now fully convinced
that an invading army was being made ready for their chastisement.
Rousing the whole confederacy of the Six Nations, Brant, the
Mohawk, and Butler, the Tory, sent their warriors to make a series of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>attacks on the American settlements, hoping thus to distract and scatter
the coming avengers. Sullivan, however, understood these tactics. He
refused to detach any pursuing parties, and pressed right on. In April
he had sent his advance guard of two hundred of the Eleventh Pennsylvania
under Major Powell to strengthen the garrison at Wyoming. On the
23d, when not far from the site of Wilkes-Barre, the party having reached,
as they thought, nearly the end of their journey, were desirous of entering
the settlement in good order and in fine personal appearance. They
halted, therefore, to brush and clean themselves, while the officers put on
their coats and ruffles. Then marching forward, but having their attention
called from possible present danger by the presence of a deer crossing
their path, they were led into an Indian ambuscade, in which several of
them were killed. In 1896 a monument was reared to their memory
by the Sons and Daughters of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another incident previous to the movement of Sullivan’s force was
in the attack, by one hundred British and two hundred Indians under command
of Captain McDonald, fifteen miles above Northumberland, Pa., on
Freeland’s Fort. This they surrounded on the 28th of July, 1779, and
compelled the garrison of thirty-two men to surrender. They also ambuscaded
Captain Boon’s party, which had marched to their relief, killing
fourteen of his men.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the same week Brant with a party of warriors moved down
the Wallkill valley, destroying the Minisink settlements in Orange county,
New York, killing many and making many prisoners. They decoyed into
an ambush more than 150 militia from Goshen, of whom over 100 were
slain. Brant then moved on to the destruction of the settlement of Lackawaxen,
which was laid in ashes and the inhabitants slain.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this was done to distract and scatter the avenging army, but
every effort failed, and the Continentals moved steadily on.</p>

<p class='c009'>General Sullivan was implored, by messengers who brought him the
terrible news, to march to the relief of the burned settlements. Wisely
and firmly he refused to detach a single soldier from his column. He
knew full well that advance into the enemy’s country would compel both
red and white foes to draw away their forces and concentrate. This
policy was really the best means of protecting the settlements. He therefore
hastened his preparations, so as to move on at the first moment
possible. On July 31, at 1 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, he broke camp at Wyoming. Determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>not to be led into ambush or to be “Braddocked,” he threw out the
riflemen in advance, to guard against surprise, and moved in line of battle.
The flotilla of boats, the line of twelve hundred pack horses and seven
hundred cattle, the park of artillery and the brigades of infantry being
all ready, the signal was given by firing a cannon on the <i>Adventurer</i>,
Proctor’s flagboat lying in the Susquehanna. The march from Wyoming
to Tioga Point, through swamps and over frightful precipices, was
safely made in good order. The procession of boats on the water and of
soldiers on land were each several miles long. Reaching Sheshequin on
the Susquehanna, the soldiers faced the flood, locked arms and forded the
swiftly flowing river at where Milan, Pa., now stands, and then again
crossed the stream to reach the peninsula at Tioga Point, where they encamped,
awaiting the arrival of their right wing, Clinton’s New York
brigade.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c012'>THE MOVEMENT OF THE RIGHT WING</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The right wing of the expedition, consisting of the 3rd, 4th and 5th New
York, the 6th Massachusetts, and 4th Pennsylvania, with four companies
of riflemen and two pieces of artillery, was under the command of General
James Clinton. This veteran officer gathered his forces at Schenectady.
He encamped his regiments around this little palisaded frontier town,
while his flotilla of over 215 boats was building in the boat yards that
then lined the Mohawk river, between the stream and the town’s wooden
walls on its north and west sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all was ready, about June 15, the boats were pushed, poled or
rowed up the river to Canajoharie. Then both the stores and the boats
were loaded on wagons drawn by four yokes of oxen, carried over the hills
and unloaded on the beach at Otsego Lake. This very toilsome work
was over by July 3, and on the “Glorious Fourth” was celebrated by a
parade, salute of cannon, divine service and a banquet with thirteen
patriotic toasts. Herds of cattle had been driven from Kingston, N. Y.,
by the great western route through the Catskill mountains, to furnish
fresh beef. The soldiers enjoyed their camp life in the fragrant woods,
though eager to move against the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>An engineer and the father of the “father of the Erie Canal,” General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Clinton’s first object was to provide enough water to float his boats
down out of the lake and into and along the shallow Susquehanna, in order
to make junction with Sullivan at Tioga Point. To secure this, in the dry
mid-summer a reservoir was made by damming up the little lake at its
source near the present Cooperstown. The flow of rain not only in this,
but also in the adjoining Schuyler Lake, during four weeks of waiting to
hear from Sullivan, was thus secured. The gain of one month’s water
from sky and earth was apparent. It is uncertain from extant journals
and diaries how high a level was reached, some saying that three feet,
but one declaring that only one foot of water was gained. At any rate,
the rise was sufficient to send the flotilla down into the valley, as if moving
on a toboggan slide.</p>

<p class='c009'>Monday, August 9, was fixed as the date of movement. On the
previous Saturday, the chaplain, the Reverend Mr. Gano, inquired of the
general whether he could break the news to the army. Being forbidden,
he asked whether he might make choice of any text he pleased. To this
full liberty was granted. When the preacher stood up before his audience
he pronounced the words in Acts xx. 7, “Ready to depart on the morrow”;
at which the faces of all the troops lightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>The glad work of chopping away the dam was begun on Sunday
night when the water rushed out, so filling the lower channels of the
river as to afford easy passage for the boats. The Tuscaroras dwelling
in the valley looking upon the swollen stream and their inundated cornfields,
deemed themselves under the wrath of the Great Spirit, and fled
in alarm. After every defeat the savages, according to their custom,
hung up white dogs to avert the anger and beg for the pity of their gods.
Our men found these tokens of primitive religion all along the route.
As the army marched overland the various settlements of Indians and
Tories were destroyed by fire and axe.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>SECOND PAPER</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>During the early summer of 1776 the American forces were
actively engaged upon a work of great magnitude, which it was
hoped would prevent the British vessels ascending the Hudson.</p>

<p class='c009'>The project was the blocking, by means of sunken vessels filled with
stone,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of the narrowest portion of the deep channel of the river.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was, and still is, the waterway extending between what is now
known as Fort Washington Point, about 178th street, then called Jeffrey’s
Hook, and the foreshore below the Palisades about due west of the
Point, under Fort Lee.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both sides were more or less protected by guns mounted in the earthworks
of Fort Washington and Fort Constitution, the extent and character
of which were not well known to the British commanders, though they
seem to have been kept pretty well informed by treacherous informers of
the progress of the work of obstructing the channel with the sunken vessels,
from the decks of which protruded masts or sharpened poles, forming a
rough “chevaux-de-frise,” a dangerous form of obstruction for wooden
vessels propelled by tide and wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>During all the spring and early summer the British naval force in
the waters around New York was represented by two very active vessels,
the sixty-four-gun man-of-war <i>Asia</i>, Captain George Vandeput, and the
forty-four-gun frigate <i>Phœnix</i>, commanded by an able and energetic
officer, Sir Hyde Parker, Jr., son of a well-known commander of the same
name, who had already done good service for his king.</p>

<p class='c009'>On June 30, the advance guard of the British fleet under Vice-Admiral
Molyneux Shuldham, Rear-Admiral of the White, arrived at
New York from Halifax. His flagship was the <i>Chatham</i>, of fifty guns
and with her was her consort, the <i>Centurion</i>, also of fifty, and the twenty
gun frigate <i>Rose</i>, which took a very active part in later affairs. By the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>first week of July the force under Shuldham had increased to fifty-four
armed vessels of all ratings, aggregating about 1200 guns in broadside,
with fully eighty supply vessels and transports laden with troops under the
command of General Howe, who had made the journey from Halifax in
the frigate <i>Greyhound</i>, of thirty guns.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 7th of July, while messengers from Philadelphia were bearing
the news of the Declaration of Independence to New York, Governor
Tryon and Howe were consulting aboard the <i>Greyhound</i> as to the
expediency of sending a naval force up the North River in order to
obstruct the supplies of the Americans. Action on this scheme was evidently
deferred pending the expected arrival of Admiral Lord Howe, the
general’s brother, with a powerful addition to the fleet.</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner was the arrival of this force announced by its advance
guard than a squadron was ordered up the North River in a bold attempt
to force their way past the obstructions at Fort Washington.</p>

<p class='c009'>The vessels selected were the <i>Phœnix</i> and <i>Rose</i>, with the armed
schooner <i>Tryal</i>, and two bomb-ketches, tenders of the two frigates, respectively
the <i>Shuldham</i> and <i>Charlotta</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be remembered that on passing the town of New York these
vessels opened a bombardment, which it has been claimed was unprovoked
by firing from the defences, and that a distressing bloodshed and panic
among the inhabitants resulted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The log or journal of Captain Hyde Parker relates the events as
follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saturday 13th. Wind. S. W. Moderate breeze and fair weather.
At 3 made the signal and weigh’d and came to sail in company with the
<i>Rose</i>, <i>Tryal</i> Schooner with the <i>Shuldham</i> and <i>Charlotta</i> Tenders, at ¾
past 3 the Battery at Red Hook on Long Island began fireing on us, on
our standing on, the Batterys on Governors Isl<sup>d</sup> and on Powle’s Hook
commenced a heavy fireing at us. At 5 minutes past 4 being then between
the last mentioned batterys we began fireing upon them at ½ past 5 we

TarryTown in 7 fathom.... In passing the Batterys Rece’d two
shott in the Hull, one on the Bowsprit and several through the Sails, and
had one Seaman and two marines wounded.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>The journal of the Captain, Sir James Wallace, is nearly identical in
the main features recorded; repeating that “the Rebels began to fire
upon us and the <i>Phenix</i>,” and confirming the material damage done to the
ship. As to this it may be remembered that Anthony Glean, who fired
the first gun at the squadron from the guns at the Battery, claimed that his

  <h2 class='c005'>THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, WITH
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO CONDITIONS IN THE ROYAL COLONY
OF NEW YORK.</p>
<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER IV (<i>Concluded</i>)<br> <span class='c012'>THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS IN NEW YORK</span></h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c013'>In the fall of 1767 a pamphlet of which a few copies were reprinted
from a London edition, appeared in New York and created considerable
excitement. It was entitled “The Conduct of Cadwallader
Colden, Esq. Lieutenant-Governor of New York, relating to the judges’
commissions:—Appeals to the King; and Stamp Duty.” It had been presented
by the grand jury in October as a libellous reflection on the Council,
the Assembly and the Courts of Justice in the province of New York, and,
as its sub-title would indicate, was a defense of Colden’s conduct, when acting
as Governor. In the course of the argument reference was made to
the action of the two branches of the Assembly in these matters, and both
bodies took umbrage and appointed a joint committee to investigate, and
if possible discover, the author and the person responsible for the republication
in New York.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The committee carried on its work with vigor, summoning among
others the printers of the province and also Colden’s son and son-in-law,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
and the matter finally ended in a report by the committee to the General
Assembly and the adoption of the following resolutions.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>“Resolved,&#160;... That the said pamphlet highly reflects upon the
honor, justice and dignity of his Majesty’s Council, the General Assembly,
and the Judges of the Supreme Court; and contains the most
malignant aspersions, upon the inhabitants of this colony in general.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Resolved, That the said pamphlet tends to destroy the confidence
of the people, in two of the branches of the legislature, and the officers
concerned in the due administration of justice; to render the government
odious and contemptible, to abate that due respect to authority, so necessary
to peace and good order, to excite disadvantageous suspicions and
jealousies in the minds of the people of Great Britain, against his
Majesty’s subjects in this colony, and to expose the colony in general, to
the resentments of the crown and both houses of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c009'>Resolved, That as the House has not been able to discover the
author of the said pamphlet, a dissolution of the general assembly is
speedily expected; his Excellency the Governor be humbly requested, in
case the author should hereafter be discovered, to order a prosecution
to be issued against him, that such punishment may be inflicted on so
great an offender as the law directs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is an instance where neither branch of the Assembly can force
an avowal of authorship from those who are suspected; a little later we
shall find in the Parker-McDougall case that the Governor and Council
did not consider it beneath their dignity to resort to very questionable
actions when they were trying to find the person responsible for a
pamphlet which displeased them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not necessary to enter here on the details of the circumstances
which finally led to the repeal of the Stamp Act and the passage of the
Mutiny Act.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The more extreme party had viewed with great disquietude
the passage of the latter act, and the way in which the Assembly
had yielded in the matter of meeting its provisions. When the Governor,
Sir Henry Moore, died on Sept. 11th, 1769 and Lieutenant-Governor
Colden once more took up the reins of government, the feeling was
intensified, and on Dec. 16th, two printed papers appeared, the first
signed “A Son of Liberty,” and the second “Legion” in which “the
betrayed inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York” were invited
to meet on the following Monday at the House of De La Montayne in
the Fields near the City, and there take steps to set forth their rights and
vindicate the privileges which the Assembly seemed unable to successfully
assert.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this meeting which was largely attended a speech was made by
John Lamb a prosperous merchant of the city.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Meanwhile the Assembly had had its attention called to the papers
and had declared the first to be “false, seditious and infamous,” and
had branded the second as “an infamous libel,” and had requested the
Lieutenant-Governor to issue his proclamation, offering a reward of £100
for the discovery of the author.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> After the meeting in the Fields the
Assembly ordered Lamb to appear before it, and examined him as to
“his conduct about the two libels” but as it did not appear that his
actions at the Fields had been in consequence of the two libels he was
allowed to depart.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> But the Assembly had not given up all hope of
finding and prosecuting the author of the two pamphlets. One of
Parker’s journeymen for the sake of the reward, gave information against
him, and on Feb. 7th Parker was arrested and examined by the Governor
and Council. While the latter was detained in a room off the Council
Chamber, his apprentices were arrested, and brought before the Council,
and although for a long time they stoutly refused to admit any knowledge
of the papers, one of them by gross intimidation was finally brought
to admit that the papers had been printed in his master’s office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Parker was then brought back before the Council, told that his
apprentice had admitted that it had been printed by him, and threatened,
in case he refused to name the author, with the loss of his position as
Secretary of the Post Office. Finally Parker, being promised indemnity,
gave information which resulted in the arrest on a bench warrant of
Alexander McDougall, who was taken before the Chief Justice, and on
refusal to admit the fact of authorship, committed to prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some seven years before this, in 1763, John Wilkes, member of
Parliament, and editor of the “North Briton” had been arrested on a
general warrant for having attacked in No. 45 of his journal the Bute
administration and abused the King, charging the latter with falsehood.
Wilkes was discharged on the ground of parliamentary privilege, and the
question being carried before the Chief Justice, Lord Camden, the latter
declared general warrants to be illegal. Wilkes was expelled by a subservient
Parliament, but was regarded by great numbers in the nation as
a martyr to the cause of liberty and freedom of discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it happened that the vote of the Assembly declaring the hand
bills libellous had been printed on the forty-fifth page of the journal.
For either this reason, or more probably because of No. 45 of the “North
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Briton” (which number was often used as a party-cry in England),
“Forty-five” became the watchword of the Sons of Liberty, at this time
a numerous body. McDougall was overrun with visitors at the jail
and was forced to issue in the “New York Weekly Journal” for Feb.
15th, a card to his friends in which he appointed the hours from three to
six in the afternoon to receive them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the same number of the Journal appears an account of one of
these receptions:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yesterday, the forty-fifth day of the year, forty-five gentlemen, real
enemies to internal taxation, by, or in obedience to external authority,
and cordial friends to Capt. McDougall, and the glorious cause of
American liberty, went in decent procession to the New Gaol; and dined
with him on forty-five pounds of beef, cut from a bullock of forty-five
months old, and with a number of other friends who joined them in the
afternoon, drank a variety of toasts, expressive not only of the most
undissembled loyalty, but of the warmest attachment to Liberty, its
renowned advocates in Great Britain and America, and the freedom of
the press. Before the evening the whole company, who conducted themselves
with great decency, separated in the most cordial manner, but not
without the firmest resolution to continue united in the glorious cause.”
In April he was indicted by the Grand Jury for libel, and being brought
to the bar pleaded not guilty and was admitted to bail.</p>

<p class='c009'>While matters were in this condition the Assembly again took the
matter up. On Dec. 13, 1770, the Speaker was directed to order McDougall
to attend at the Bar of the House to answer a complaint made
against him by Mr. De Noyellis for being the supposed author or publisher
of the paper signed “A Son of Liberty.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> On his attending,
McDougall was asked whether he was or was not the author of the
paper. He replied “That as the grand jury and house of Assembly had
declared the paper in question to be a libel, he could not answer the question.
Secondly, that as he was under prosecution in the Supreme Court,
he conceived it would be an infraction of the laws of Justice to punish a
British subject twice for one offense, for that no line could be run, that he
might be punished without end; but he would not be understood to deny
the authority of the house to punish for a breach of privilege, when no
cognizance is taken of it in another Court.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>The Assembly decided that this was a contempt of the authority of
the house, and, since he refused to ask pardon of the house, he was
ordered into the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and placed in the
county jail.</p>

<p class='c009'>A writ of Habeas Corpus was sued out before the Court of Justice,
whereupon the sheriff notified the house and asked what he should do.
A committee was appointed on Jan. 22d, 1771, “to search the journals of
the house of Commons, for precedents in cases where writs of habeas
corpus have been issued, to bring persons committed by the Commons
before other Courts.” The committee reported on Feb. 16, that several
precedents had been found, which precedents were ordered printed in the
Journal of the House. It was also determined that the sheriff should be
indemnified for his action in not obeying the order of the Court.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Assembly was prorogued on March 4, 1771, and did not come
together till Jan. 7, 1772, and we hear no more of the McDougall affair.
About this time Parker died and as he was the principal witness in the
case it was probably considered useless to bring up the indictment before
the Court.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this time on, pamphlets, opposing the Crown and its policy of
repression, continued to appear in ever increasing number, but the government
made no serious sign of opposition, and seemed to have given
up in despair the attempt to control a press which the majority of the
people warmly supported.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c012'>THE PRESS IN THE SOUTHERN COLONIES</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>In the Southern colonies we find, as we should expect, an absence of any
very important cases bearing on the subject under consideration.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ideas of Sir Wm. Berkeley, (for thirty-eight years Governor
of Virginia), in regard to the dissemination of information, may be
gathered from a reply made by him to some enquiries of the Lords Commissioners
of Foreign Plantations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The question being “What course is taken about the instructing the
people, within your government in the Christian religion; and what provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>is there made for the paying of your minister?” his answer is:
“The same course that is taken in England out of towns: every man
according to his ability instructing his children. We have forty-eight
parishes, and our ministers are well paid, and by my consent should be
better if they would pray oftener and preach less. But of all other commodities,
so of this, the worst is sent us, and we had few that we could
boast of, since the persecution in Cromwell’s tiranny drove divers worthy
men hither. But, I thank God, we have not free schools nor printing;
and I hope we shall not have these hundred years. For learning has
brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the world; and printing
has divulged them and libels against the government. God keep us from
both.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>At the beginning of the last quarter of the seventeenth century Virginia
suffered from internal disorders (as Bacon’s Rebellion), due to
political disturbances having their origin in the English Civil War. Lord
Culpepper, the Governor, was inclined to stretch the royal prerogative to
its furthest limit and met the murmurings of the Assembly with a cold
and gloomy dignity.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The Assembly insisting on its rights as given in the charters, Lord
Culpepper dissolved the body and endeavored to stamp out all remembrance
of past freedom. In the Bland MS. p. 498,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> we find the following
entry: “Feb. 21, 1682, John Buckner called before the Lord Culpepper
and his Council for printing the laws of 1680, without his Excellency’s
license, and he and the printer ordered to enter into bond in £100
not to print anything thereafter, until his majesty’s pleasure should be
known.” Thus, the press was strangled at its birth, since we have no
record or copy of any other work, and that the government continued to
watch carefully lest it should appear again is proven by the Instructions
of Lord Effingham, the next Governor, in which he is ordered “to allow
no person to use a printing press on any occasion whatsoever.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In the period between 1733, when Wm. Parks established his press
at Williamsburg, and 1765 when Wm. Rind began to issue a paper at
Williamsburg, there was but the single press in Virginia, and being the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>organ of the government it may be easily imagined that it had no great
temptation to struggle for the liberty of the press.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the exception of libel suits against Wm. Parks about the year
1740 (by which the House of Burgesses sought to punish him for publishing
an article reflecting on one of the members), and the presentment
in 1766 of Rind, and of Purdie and Dixon, the publishers of the two Virginia
Gazettes (for referring in a way considered improper, to the bailment
of Colonel Chiswell), in both of which instances the prosecution
failed utterly in its attempt,—there is nothing on the subject which claims
our attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>In South Carolina the press was encouraged, liberal inducements
being held out to any printer who would settle in the colony. As a result
of this policy we find the printing press in operation from the year 1730,
a newspaper being published in 1731. In the early period of the history
of the press in the colony the only cause of serious trouble that we find
was one involving Peter Timothy, of the Gazette, who had published a
letter by one Hugh Bryan in which occurred the statement that “the
clergy of South Carolina broke their Canons daily.” With Timothy
were also arrested Bryan and George Whitefield, the Evangelist, who
had corrected the manuscript. All three were admitted to bail, and the
matter was dropped.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1773 one of the most important cases that ever occurred in the
colonies came about through the publication in the South Carolina
Gazette, then owned by Timothy and a partner whom he had lately taken,
named Thomas Powell, but managed entirely by the latter, of a portion
of the proceedings of the Council on the previous day. Being summoned
to attend the body, he admitted that he was the publisher of the Gazette,
and that he had printed the proceedings, which on being asked he said
had been brought to him by the Hon. Wm. Henry Drayton, a member of
the Council. The Council then adjudged him “guilty of a high breach
of the privileges, and a contempt of the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Powell refused to ask pardon of the Council which then,</p>

<p class='c009'>“Resolved, That Thomas Powell, who hath this day been adjudged
by this house, to have been guilty of a high breach of privilege, and a
contempt of this house, be for his said offense committed to the Common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>Gaol of Charleston; and that his Honor, the President of this house, do
issue his warrant accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Drayton, who was present, and had acknowledged his share in
the affair, protested strongly, but without avail, and Powell was placed in
prison. Two days later, on Sept. 2d, the Hon. Rawlins Lowndes, and
Mr. George Gabriel Powell, the former being Speaker of the Assembly,
and the latter one of the members of the body, and both being justices of
the peace, had Powell brought before them on a writ of Habeas Corpus
and discharged him. The Council then took action in these resolutions:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Resolved, That the power of commitment is so necessarily incident
to each house of Assembly, that without it neither their authority nor
dignity can in any degree whatsoever be maintained or supported.</p>

<p class='c009'>Resolved, That Rawlins Lowndes, Esqr., Speaker of the Commons
House of Assembly, and George Gabriel Powell, Esqr. member
of the said house, being two justices of the peace, <i>unus quorum</i>, lately
assistant judges and justices of his majesty’s court of Common Pleas,
have, by virtue of habeas corpus by them issued, caused the body of T.
Powell to be brought before them, on the second of this instant September,
and the said justices, disregarding the commitment of this house, did
presumptuously discharge T. Powell out of the custody of the sheriff
under the commitment of this house.</p>

<p class='c009'>Resolved, That the said justices have been guilty of the most
atrocious contempt of this house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The resolution which follows calls upon the Assembly to disavow
the action of these men and give them up to receive proper punishment.
This the Assembly refused to do, and then both houses carried the matter
on petition to the Crown, and it had not been settled when the breaking
out of the Revolutionary War put an end to the affair.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this case the attempt of the upper house to destroy the liberty of
the press, was opposed by the desire of the lower house to uphold it, and
the fact that this occurred on the eve of the Revolution is significant,
teaching us that even to the last the principle that the press must be free
had not been established in the American colonies.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='c012'>CONCLUSION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We have had brought before us all the instances of any importance,
throughout the American colonies of efforts on the part of the government
to control the liberty of the press. Let us now attempt to deduce from
them the general principles which governed the matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the first place it is clear that, as the several colonies differed the
one from another in their relations with and dependence upon the home
government and their Governor, who represented that government, so
too the press was in some colonies far more free from control than in
others. In Massachusetts, where interference from outside was always
resisted, control by the Governor was seldom attempted. Before the
administration of Governor Andros the Crown made no attempt to interfere;
Andros himself appointed Edward Randolph (vide p. 9) as
licenser, and Bartholomew Green, the Boston publisher testifies (vide p.
10) to the fact that in his time (the end of the seventeenth century),
Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton took a keen interest in the productions
of the press, and refused to allow any publications without a previous application
to him, with a copy of the matter to be published. After this
period the control by the Crown again was lost in that as also in political
matters.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Pennsylvania we have an instance of a Governor representing an
individual proprietor. Here the struggle between the people and Penn’s
representative in political matters was carried over into the field occupied
by the press, and so we find in the early period of the existence of the
press a dual authority exercised, the Crown and the Quarterly Meeting,
both claiming the right of censorship (vide p. 23). In the first half of
the eighteenth century the power of the Quakers passed away as far as
our subject is concerned, but the control exercised by the Crown continued,
although more and more questioned, until the breaking out of the Revolutionary
struggle.</p>

<p class='c009'>In New York the Governor himself was responsible for the introduction
of the press and for forty years (1692–1734), it took no active
part in political agitations, maintaining a cautious neutrality under Bradford.
In this colony it was rather a question of the right to freedom of
speech, a question raised in the prosecution of Col. Nicholas Bayard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>From the period of the Zenger trial newspapers continued to increase and
the twenty-five years before 1775 witnessed a continuous production of
pamphlets in which the Crown and its representative were attacked, the
efforts to punish by the government being in almost every case entirely
futile. The press divides itself into two groups, the supporters and
opponents of the Governor, and the party newspaper becomes a reality.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the Southern colonies the press never attained any liberty, the
government being ever on the watch to repress the smallest attempt at
freedom of discussion and criticism.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the second place we find that the attitude assumed by the inhabitants
of the colonies, as expressed by the actions of their representatives,
varied in the different colonies. We do find this general similarity, that
in all there was a very jealous upholding of the rights of the legislative
body as against criticism. That can be easily established by a perusal
of the Minutes of any of the Assemblies. But in Massachusetts a distinction
seems to have been early established between a criticism of the
proceedings of the General Court as such, and a criticism of the policy of
the government. In Pennsylvania this view was only in the latter period
arrived at; in New York the General Assembly was constantly taking
offense at writings appearing in the newspapers or distributed in the
form of pamphlets; while in Virginia the question never arose because
there was no criticism.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everywhere we find that there was, as time goes on, a general
advance towards freedom of discussion. But this is best seen in nonpolitical
matters. With the failure by Parliament in 1695 to renew the
Licensing Act all publication became at least theoretically free except in
so far as it was restrained by the law of libel. To just what extent this
law could be stretched was always a matter of dispute. The maxim “the
greater the truth, the greater the libel” must certainly have exercised an
influence to deter the publications of the time from the discussion of
private affairs. In fact in many instances the news contained in an issue
of a newspaper was practically nothing, the few columns being occupied
with a very bald statement of Indian affairs, or the relations with France
or perhaps a short account of something which had taken place in England
or on the Continent. The needs of the community, as better roads
or the impounding of wandering cattle, were lightly touched on, but
there was but slight evidence of any conception of the idea that the press
could lead and direct public opinion as to municipal affairs.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>In political matters not directly affecting the Crown there was also
a slight advance towards freedom of discussion, which, as the time of the
Revolution approached, became very much extended. But here again
no general rule can be established for the more radical colonies, as
Massachusetts, would naturally be far in advance of the more conservative,
while between would stand New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of one thing we may be confident. In no colony would the Governor,
as representing the Crown, permit a criticism of its actions to pass
without censure, and, if possible, punishment. When the Evening Post
of Boston (vide p. 14) published in 1741 the paragraph in regard to the
expected overthrow of the Walpole Ministry, the Attorney-General was
at once ordered to file an Information against the printer, Thomas Fleet,
and although no further proceedings were ever taken, the omission was
due rather to want of confidence in the Massachusetts jury than to any
leniency on the part of the Governor. In the case of McDougall (vide
p. 65), we find the writer of a pamphlet obnoxious to the Crown kept in
prison even against a writ of Habeas Corpus, and only released when the
death of the principal witness in the case made his conviction impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>The liberty of the press was still further curtailed by the influence
exerted by certain classes in the community. There was always a strong
feeling among those who had grants of land (either directly from the
Crown or by the Crown as confirmatory of purchases already made from
the Indians), against any discussion of their rights over those who were
their tenants. This influence would of course be of importance only in
the colonies where grants were numerous, as in the colony of New York.
But another class influence, that of the Clergy, was far stronger at all
times and universal in its extent. In Massachusetts and Pennsylvania it
is hardly possible to overestimate the importance of this influence, and in
none of the colonies can it be neglected if we desire to properly appreciate
the difficulties that faced the printer in his struggle for the right of free
discussion. The troubles of Wm. Bradford, the elder in Pennsylvania
(vide p. 26), and of James Franklin in Massachusetts (vide p. 11), give
us a pretty clear idea of the troubles that would beset the man who did
not keep himself out of controversy. Just as the New England Election
Sermons give us perhaps the best means of understanding the influence
of the Clergy in the field of politics, so these quarrels between printer and
Quarterly Meeting or Presbytery show us the feeling toward freedom of
discussion.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>REMINISCENCES OF ROBERT FULTON</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c021'>Among the relics of Robert Fulton in possession of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers at their house in New York
City is a manuscript (hitherto unpublished, it is believed), in
which in 1859 the only surviving associate of the inventor recorded his
recollections. These simple and obviously honest reminiscences from the
hand of a plain man become of interest, however deficient in literary art.
He was J. B. Calhoun of Brooklyn, and told his story thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>“In 1807 Mr. Fulton’s first boat, the <i>North River</i>, of Clermont,
commenced running on the Hudson River to Albany. Between 1809 and
1811, he had two more, the <i>Car of Neptune</i> and the <i>Paragon</i>. Each
steamer had two masts—on the foremast was a square sail, two topsails,
and a jib. On the mainmast was a spanker and topsail. The foremast
had at the heel trunnions by which the mast could be lowered when the
wind was ahead. When the wind was fair, all hands, passengers too,
were called to raise the mast and set sail.</p>

<p class='c009'>These steamers had high or poop decks some four feet above the
main deck; the entrance to the cabin was by the old-fashioned ship companionway—not
a house on deck. These steamers, being on the bottom
as flat as a house floor, each had two heavy side lee boards, to prevent
making leeway when sail was set. In those days neither the pilot nor
engineer had an assistant, nor the captain any clerk. In leaving New
York at five, the pilot would take the wheel until supper; after supper he
would again take the wheel and keep it till next morning; he had no fine
pilot-house, not even an awning to protect him from the hot sun nor the
most severe weather. When coming to landings, instead of a bell to ring,
the pilot blew a tin horn some five feet long; the bell was used only for
meal times....</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Fulton had at North Point, Jersey City, four large shops, and
a dry-dock some 200 feet long, 36 feet wide, and 16 feet deep to repair his
boats in; the first dry-dock in this country. In those days such a thing as
a cut-off, a throttle-valve, or an eccentric was not known by the engineer.</p>

<p class='c009'>To make the trip to Albany took from twenty-six to thirty hours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>burning in that time about thirty cords of firewood. None of Mr. Fulton’s
steamers made the trip in less than twenty-five hours. In 1813 Mr.
Louis Rhoda, Mr. Fulton’s chief engineer, was killed on the trial trip of
the ferry-steamboat on the East River, the <i>Nassau</i>, by being caught in the
engine when in motion. He had his entire right shoulder taken from his
body by the crank. Mr. Rhoda was the first engineer killed in this
country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then follows a paragraph descriptive of Fulton’s personal appearance
and manners. The sketch adds:</p>

<p class='c009'>“His death was rather sudden; so much so that many attributed it to
suicide. This was not so; he died a calm, natural death in the bosom of
his family, at No. 5 Broadway, opposite the Bowling Green. In attending
court at Trenton, N. J., he had taken a cold, and on returning home to
New York the ferryboat on which he was was caught in the ice, and was
thus delayed some three hours. It was a cold, stormy day in January;
this confirmed and increased his illness, which finally sent him to his grave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1811 Mr. Fulton built at Pittsburgh, Pa., a boat for the New
Orleans trade; she was called the <i>New Orleans</i>, the first steamer on the
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1810–11 a company was formed—they built two boats to run in
opposition to Mr. Fulton’s. One was called <i>Perseverance</i>, Captain
Bunker, and the other <i>The Hope</i>, Captain Sherman, afterwards well
known on Lake Champlain. These steamers were some faster than Mr.
Fulton’s. After a long contest in courts of law, the two Albany boats
were confiscated to Mr. Fulton, and he had them soon broken up at
Albany, in sight of their former owners.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1812–13 some gentlemen in New York built a steamer called the
<i>Fulton</i>, to run to Albany, by Mr. Fulton’s consent, under the following
terms: The new boat was to charge $10 for each passenger, paying Mr.
Fulton $3 out of every $10 paid by the passengers; this did not prove
profitable, and the next season the <i>Fulton</i> was placed on the East River
and the Sound, being the first steamer ever before on the Sound....
It was expected that the steamer <i>Fulton</i> would make the trip to Albany in
thirteen or fourteen hours’ time, but I think she never made the trip in less
than sixteen or seventeen hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first steamer on the Potomac River, Va., was built by Mr. Fulton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>in the last days of his life; she was called the <i>Washington</i>; she was intended
to run between Washington City and Norfolk; she went there in
May, 1815; the writer of these lines went out with her and stayed long
enough to teach a black man, a slave, how to start and how to manage
the engine.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first steamer for the great Western Lakes was built at Black
Rock on the Niagara River by Mr. Noah Brown of New York, in 1818.
She was a handsome vessel of 360 tons’ burden, full brig-rigged. She
was called the <i>Walk-in-the-Water</i>. She was owned by Dr. J. B. Stewart,
then of Albany. The writer put up her engine. She was totally lost in
a terrible gale on Lake Erie, in October, 1820. In these years from 1818
to 1820, no dividends were made from the earnings of the steamer. Such
was the little travel on those lakes at these times that if the steamer carried
thirty or forty passengers, it was doing pretty well. The strength of the
Black Rock Rapids was so strong that besides the power of the engine, it
required the use of eight pairs of oxen to get the steamer up the rapids on
to the lake, a distance of two miles.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first steamer that made the trip to Albany in twelve hours was
the steamer <i>Sun</i>, of which the writer was the engineer. She was a double
engine, called the Woolf engine, high and low pressure—had six high-pressure
boilers, 24 feet long, and 30 inches in diameter, intended to carry
120 pounds of steam—cylinder, four feet stroke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first attempt to use hard coal on a steamer on the Hudson River
was made by the Messrs. Mowatt on the steamer <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Henry
Eckford</i> in 1825. Wood and coal were tried together; then coal alone.
The trial was not successful, but it was soon seen that what was wanted
was a strong draft or the use of some kind of a blower. The writer received
$50 for making the trial. In those days, blowers were unknown.
The first blower was introduced by the late Robert L. Stevens, on board
the <i>North America</i> in 1826.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the year 1827 the steam chimney was introduced by the late
J. P. Allaire. He claimed he had a patent for the same, but I think he
had not.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1825 the steam towing business was commenced by the late
Mowatts on the Hudson River, with the steamboat <i>Henry Eckford</i> and
six barges. About the same year Mr. William C. Redfield introduced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>passenger-barge, towing, with the steamers <i>Swift-sure</i> and <i>Abe Commerce</i>
and the barges <i>Lady Clinton</i> and <i>Lady Van Rensselaer</i>; it was an aristocratic
[venture]—got up to catch the support of the rich and powerful,
but it did not succeed well, and in two years it went down.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the fixtures about the ferry landings, the bridges, the floating box
underneath, the chains and pulleys, were all invented by Mr. Fulton.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have many things in my memory in regard to him. All of the
above was written wholly from memory; not one word or a line of reference
have I had before me while writing this historical record of old
times. When I get in good health I have much to say on these subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Apparently he never “got in good health,” for no other record of
his than this is known.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>DOMINIE SOLOMON FROELIGH AND HIS GREAT SCHISM</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c021'>No region in the vicinity of New York has more natural beauty or
historic interest than that lying west of the Palisades. Until a
few years ago it was to most people an almost unknown land.
Hackensack, Englewood, Paterson, and Passaic were familiar names;
but the country north of these was seldom visited. Recently the valleys
of the Ramapo, Pascack, Saddle, and Hackensack Rivers have attracted
many suburban homeseekers, and their character is rapidly changing.
Yet their charm still centers in the ancient stone farmhouses that speak
of a civilization that has lasted for two hundred and fifty years. In
some of the villages are churches built in early colonial times, and about
these cluster the graves of the forefathers. New names have been given
to many of the hamlets, and the present residents know little and care
less for their past history. Only in musty records, and fading memories,
do the ancient Indian and Dutch names survive. Ka Keat, Mahakemack,
Minesing, Aquackanock, are some of these. From Tappan on
the north to English Neighborhood on the south, a distance of thirty
miles, this country, except in the four chief towns, was until a generation
ago stagnant; its population was no greater than at the beginning of the
nineteenth century. A few years since, the writer journeyed with a
friend to one of its ancient churchyards, to commit to its grave the body
of an aged lady. There it rests with those of ten generations of the
Bogarts, Brinkerhoffs, Demarests, Zabriskies, and other historic families.</p>

<p class='c009'>A number of natives had gathered at the porch of the church on the
capstone of whose arch was engraved “Nisi Dominus Frustra.” As this
is the motto of the Reformed Church of America I, as one of its ministers,
felt at home. The day was stormy, and I asked that the building might
be opened for a funeral service. The gentleman addressed said he feared
that this was impossible, as the pastor was opposed to such a proceeding.
The parsonage was next to the church, and I sent word to the minister
asking him to assist me in the burial office. My card was returned with a
curt refusal. The old sexton was more communicative, and from him I
learned the story of this “True Reformed Dutch Church”; could this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>have been reported word for word it would rival in interest the best of
Miss Wilkins’ or Mrs. Wiggin’s tales.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two facts remain in my memory; first, that Dr. Solomon Froeligh
was to this peculiar people all that Knox had been to those who sat under
the Scotch Reformer; and, second, that the True Reformed Dutch Church
was the remnant of God’s elect; for the rest of Christendom had irrevocably
passed under condemnation.</p>

<p class='c009'>With these experiences in mind I have as far as possible gathered
the facts that outline the story of a schism which, nearly a hundred years
ago, threatened to disrupt the Reformed Dutch Church, then relatively
among the largest of Protestant denominations. Dr. Chambers, in the
Schaff-Herzog Encyclopædia, has stated: “The True Reformed Dutch
Church is the result of a secession led by the Rev. Solomon Froeligh, a
learned man. The reasons assigned for the separation were that the
Dutch Church had become erroneous in doctrine, lax in discipline, and
corrupt in practice. The secession, however, did not adopt any new
standards. At one time it was very formidable, numbering over one hundred
churches and as many ministers. But it now numbers hardly a
dozen churches. It was a great injury to the church from which it seceded,
but it is hard to see what service it has been to its own members, or
to anybody else.” This statement, while judicious, is hardly comprehensive.
The cause of the disruption was perverse human nature; pride,
envy, and jealousy had much to do with it, and the effect was that a
people who might have led in the moral and material growth of the State
retrograded. The evil it caused brought disaster to upwards of a thousand
families who had possessed every advantage of birth, property, and
intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The beginning of the settlement of the region I have described was
almost coeval with that of New Amsterdam. Later the occupation of
New York by the English led to a large emigration thither of Dutch families
from Manhattan and Long Island. Slowly and painfully these early
settlers removed the forests, drained the swamps, and established their
homes. The organization of Dutch churches in the neighborhoods of
this section began immediately. The people were intelligent and devout
as well as thrifty. Godly and learned clergymen, among whom were
Taschmaker, Varick, Bertholf, Schuyler, and Van Benschoten, soon
gathered large congregations. The story of the labors of these men is
one of a heroism and devotion hardly equalled in colonial history. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>minutes of the synod of 1778 reported seventeen strong churches in the
district. In 1818 the classes of Bergen and Paramus, into which it was
divided, reported 2,400 communicant members, and more than 15,000
persons in the congregations. At this later date some of these churches
were larger than those in the cities of New York and Albany.</p>

<p class='c009'>For many years the most influential man in the region, and in the
estimation of his admirers in the Dutch Church, was Dr. Solomon Froeligh,
minister of the Collegiate Churches of Hackensack and Schraalenburgh.
Born near Albany in 1750, he had spent his boyhood in Walkill
valley. There, and in the adjacent Catskill district, the venerable Schuneman
ruled for fifty years like a bishop of mediæval times. He was the
lawyer, physician, pastor, and friend of a large and scattered flock, among
whom his wisdom and authority were unquestioned. A narrative of his
life and labors is told in a story of some sixty years ago called “The
Dutch Dominie of the Catskills.” Through his guidance Froeligh was
led to dedicate himself to the ministry. For ten years he studied under
Dr. Dirck Romeyn of Schenectady—the founder of Union College—and
Dr. Peter Wilson of Hackensack, for many years a leading professor in
Kings College. Although he never visited Princeton, the College of New
Jersey conferred on Froeligh at eighteen years of age the degree of master
of arts, because of his profound attainments. He became a favorite of
Dr. John Livingston, whom Mrs. Jay, the wife of the chief justice, named
to Washington as the first citizen of New York. This great man, long
the unquestioned leader of the Dutch Church, was accustomed to make
progresses through the various congregations; on two at least of these,
and the time occupied was frequently several months, Froeligh accompanied
him. Upon his licensure in 1775 he received four calls, of which
he accepted that of the Collegiate Churches of Queens County, Jamaica,
Newtown, Success, and Oyster Bay. In 1776 his house near Newtown,
containing his valuable library, and all his earthly possessions, was burned
by the British, and he barely escaped death at their hands. For the eight
succeeding years he went up and down New York and New Jersey as a
missionary and fearless patriot. At the close of the war for independence
he accepted a call to become the colleague of the Rev. Warmardus Kuypers
in the pastorate of the Collegiate Churches of Hackensack and
Schraalenburgh. Shortly after this, he was named by the General Synod
of the Church together with Drs. Livingston and Romeyn, a professor of
theology. For thirty years he held this office, and trained for the ministry
nearly one hundred young men.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>By inheritance Dr. Froeligh was a strong, self-sufficient man. His
education and life accentuated these traits. His intercourse during the
impressionable years of youth with such masters as Schuneman, Romeyn
and Livingston must have developed in him an aptitude to command. In
scholarship he was in a narrow sense profound. His early possession of
the seat of authority led to a certain dogmatism. He was pronounced
hyper-Calvinist, and ever ready to defend his extreme views. The synods
of the Church were in that day the great events of each year, not only for
clergymen but laymen. In these Dr. Froeligh was ever the leading controversialist.
Both tradition and records show that he was strenuous to
harshness in manner, unyielding, and exacting in statement, and always
ready to estrange a friend rather than bend in the least. Combined with
these traits there was in him a vein of mysticism. He dreamed dreams
and saw visions that were to him authoritative communications of the
Most High. Naturally such a man gathered about him devoted and
obedient followers, and at the same time offended and antagonized many.
Religion and politics were then, far more than in our day, issues of intense
personal moment to all thoughtful persons. Party spirit blazed fiercely
in every community. In the memorable Presidential contest of 1800,
when the Federalist party was defeated, Dr. Froeligh was an elector and
voted for Jefferson. What this meant to most of the ministers and influential
laymen of the Church, who were devoted to Hamilton, can be
surmised.</p>

<p class='c009'>As years passed his character did not soften, nor could he accept
defeat gracefully. Gradually, new and younger leaders in the Church
came to the front. Men like Milldoler, Brownlee, Broadhead, and
Fonda, whom he would not treat as his equals, paid him less and less
deference. But his chief antipathy was his neighbor of Paramus, once
his own scholar, Dr. Wilhelm Eltinge. They were men much alike in
character, who invariably stood on opposite sides of every question.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the churches of Hackensack and Schraalenburgh, while ruled
by one Consistory, were far from friendly to each other. They were rich
in property, having inherited thousands of acres of farm land, and their
members were noted for their wealth. Even before Froeligh’s day there
was bitter rivalry between the two. Mr. Kuypers, Froeligh’s colleague,
was a gentle and infirm man, who, above all things, hated discord. He
readily yielded to his energetic associate. As the years passed the friction
between the communities and factions in each church grew. Questions
as to the sale of property, the rebuilding of churches, assessments of costs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>and the like were constantly rising. On these friends parted and even
families divided. At length four separate consistories and congregations
were established, one for each minister in each place, but all in one corporation.
During the earlier years of his settlement Dr. Froeligh sought
to act the part of peacemaker. Not understanding the grounds for the
fierce disputes, he diligently set himself to enforce agreement, and by the
exercise of his masterful will partially succeeded.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1799 Mr. Kuypers died, and the question of his successor became
a burning one. The dominie was, of course, intensely interested, and
took a decided stand against a majority. During a summer storm a bolt
of lightning split the tablet over the door of the largest church, on which
was engraved “Endraacht maakt macht”—union makes strength. Taking
this as a sign from heaven, Dr. Froeligh proclaimed in his sermon on
the following Sunday, “It is our belief founded on what we have seen
and know of this people that, according to the sign given on July 10, the
Triune God has made them two. The fire of divine grace is on one side,
and the fire of discord and rage is on the other.” Even under such conditions
the dominie was master of the situation, and held the reins tightly.
He was sole minister of four rich churches, and by ecclesiastical law each
meeting of the consistory was subject to his call. By the civil law he
was president of the corporation, and no business could be transacted
without his presence. At last, in 1800, the General Synod of the Church
intervened, and by the exercise of its supreme authority placed Dr. J. V.
C. Romeyn in Mr. Kuypers’ stead. It also divided the old Classis of
Hackensack into two, with Dr. Froeligh’s two churches in that of Paramus,
and Dr. Romeyn’s in that of Bergen. Dr. Froeligh entered a
solemn protest against this action, and began a course of systematic effort
to undo the arrangement. For eighteen years the controversy continued.
It is needless to particularize the phases of this unhappy church quarrel.
At last, in 1818, the crisis came. Proceedings under church law were instituted
against Dr. Froeligh on the question whether the ministry or
spiritual consistory composed of the elders of a church, was the responsible
party in the matter of receiving or dismissing members. The Classis
of Paramus sided with Dr. Froeligh, the next higher court, the Particular
Synod, sustained Dr. Romeyn, and then, in 1822, the General Synod, in
perhaps the most memorable trial in her history, decided against Dr. Froeligh.
Thereupon, he and the ministers and elders of nine churches, signed
their names to a document declaring that they had formed themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>into a separate body by the name and title of “The True Reformed Dutch
Church in America.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Those who recall Mrs. Stowe’s story, “The Minister’s Wooing,”
need not be told of the great controversy in New England caused by the
sermons of Dr. Hopkins of Newport. In the light of to-day, few if any
in the ministry accept his theology because of its narrowness. But a hundred
years ago men like Froeligh regarded Hopkins as a dangerous heretic,
and sought to cast out of the church as Pelagians those who sided with
him. So long as the dominie could rule the Classis of Paramus he was
reasonably content, but when Dr. Eltinge and a majority of its members
approved of the Hopkins position, the Dutch Church seemed without the
pale. Doubtless his greatest sorrow was that the old leaders he most
admired, like Dr. Livingston, refused to join in the controversy. The
younger men who were shaping the missionary activities of the church,
and planning the constitution that was adopted in 1832, ignored him.
No wonder he became embittered. But he had a large following of
sincere, earnest, though narrow men. They had been in their early years
his students and he was still their oracle. So the schism became formidable.
After taking this final step he made a proselyting tour among the
churches in the Hudson and Mohawk valleys. A score of these joined
his new communion. As many more were completely disrupted, and soon
ceased to exist. Side by side in fifty hitherto peaceful, united, and prosperous
villages rival congregations began a bitter warfare. Accusations
against the teaching character and morals of ministers and laymen were
published. In the church courts notable trials were held. In some cases
the peace of the State was broken, and the civil authorities invoked. Indeed,
the actions at law caused by this secession in New York and New
Jersey led to the establishment of principles as to the rights of members
in church property that are to-day the basis of the ecclesiastical law in
both States. Probably the most famous case was that of the Church of
the English Neighborhood in New Jersey. It was argued before the
Supreme Court by Messrs. Wood and Hornblower on one side, and Van
Arsdale and Theodore Frelinghuysen on the other. Chief Justice Ewing
delivered the opinion of the court. These five named leaders are probably
the most prominent in the history of the New Jersey bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I have gathered from many sources the facts herein set forth, the
most interesting and impressive feature of the controversy is the sane and
dignified manner with which the church met the issue. Every lawful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>means was adopted to first reunite and then recover the seceding churches,
and, so far as the records show, this was ever in the spirit of the Christian
rule of kindness. When these efforts failed all loyal members were urged
to live in charity with their neighbors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Until 1850 the “True Reformed Dutch Church” grew in strength.
It concentrated all its powers on the one aim of proselyting adherents
from the mother Church. Wherever possible it effected discord in congregations
and families. It took no part in the missionary or philanthropic
movements of the day. Its members gloried in being a “peculiar
people,” whose “good works” consisted in nursing pride and standing
apart from all others.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have hardly touched on the pathetic side of this history. At the
beginning of the nineteenth century the Dutch Reformed Church in America
stood in a unique position. In the center of the country she was
the oldest Protestant communion, and relatively the strongest. More
nearly than any other her policy coincided with that of the United States.
In temper and trend she was highly irenic. Her liturgy and confessions
were simply Christian; and her genius made her one with true Christians
of every name. No wonder that the hopes of a great multitude, both
within and without her communion, for a homogeneous body that should
do away with the multitude of ecclesiastical divisions centered in her. It
was largely due to the schism Dr. Froeligh led that these hopes were
shattered. The natural growth of the Church was checked at the most
important period of the country’s development. Beginning at the close
of the Revolution, wise and devoted leaders had planted a large number
of Dutch churches on the then frontiers; these were everywhere prospering.
In Central and Western New York, in Upper Canada, in West
New Jersey, and Eastern Pennsylvania new congregations were constantly
being organized. Then came the disruption. Fully two-thirds of these
newer churches were broken up. In North Jersey, and Rockland County,
New York, an unwholesome emigration of embittered people began.
Families were broken up, neighbors estranged, and the material as well
as moral growth of the section was checked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Possibly other communities as well as churches gained large accessions
through this secession. But people of this description are too selfish
and disputatious to foster the peace of any neighborhood. It is well that
their children should ignore and forget the ways of their fathers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now all that is left of the True Dutch Church are some ten dying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>congregations. Each year or so one of these is disrupted. Civil and
sometimes criminal actions at law follow, and the costs of the proceedings
absorb the remainders of the property. But the remnant still cling to
their name and glory in their history; for they still invoke the shades of
Doctor Solomon Froeligh.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A DAY IN THE GREAT DISMAL SWAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>[The stories and legends associated with the Swamp are many. The most
authentic and pathetic of all, and the one which Thomas Moore has made the theme
of a poem, is to this effect: a young man who lost his mind on the death of the girl
he loved, disappeared, and was never heard from. As he had frequently said, in his
delirium, that she was not dead, but gone in a canoe to the Swamp, it is supposed
that he wandered there in search of her, and died from exposure.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c021'>It seemed as if we had hardly been asleep an hour when a knock resounded
on our door, and a voice from the outside said: “Six
o’clock, ladies; breakfast will be ready in fifteen minutes, and the
carriage will be here at half-past six.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With half-shut eyes we made our toilet, and we were even too sleepy
to enjoy the well-cooked breakfast which was spread for us in the dining-room
of the little Suffolk inn where we had taken lodging for the night on
our arrival by train from Norfolk.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were not thoroughly awake and interested in the adventure we
were about to undertake, until we found ourselves with guide books and
lunch box on the back seat of a springless carriage, the front seat of which
was occupied by a fat negro, with a good-natured grin, who answered to
the name of “Moses.” We had a three-mile drive before us to the
entrance of the Swamp, where we were to meet our guide and take the
boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first stage of our journey lay through the main street of a sleepy
little Virginia town. The sun had not yet dried the dewdrops, and the
old white, pillared houses on either side of the highway, where the great
elms overlapped their branches, were still wrapped in the quiet of the
early morning. Farther along the street, when we reached the shops,
there were more signs of life. Men, who looked like planters of antebellum
days, were taking possession of the chairs which occupied the sidewalk
and the porch of a small hotel. Negroes and mules and great bunches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of bananas were seen on every hand. But we soon left all these behind
and were out in the open country. Level, green fields lay on either
side of us. It was a lonely road, in spite of the greenness and the sunshine
round about us. Occasionally we passed a weather-beaten negro
cabin, and once we saw, looming in the distance, a white plantation mansion,
stately still, in spite of years of neglect.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed to us that this monotonous road might run on indefinitely,
when, suddenly, Moses halted his horses, without apparent cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’ah we is, I reckon, missus,” said he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It can’t be,” returned my traveling companion. “I see nothing
like a swamp.” And then we both of us looked closely at the only object
in the landscape—a clump of willow bushes, seeming to cover the beginning
of a brook that led nowhere in particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes’m, he’ah we be su’ah,” reiterated Moses. “An’ he’ah’s Massa
Alphonso now,” and he pointed to a light-haired, lank Virginian, who, at
that moment, appeared from behind the bushes, and stood leaning on an
oar.</p>

<p class='c009'>The man combined the stateliness of a courtier with the roughness
of a hunter, and the grace of his attitude and his blonde beauty led the
Spinster to christen him “The Lohengrin of the Swamp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The object of this unspoken christening now came forward and introduced
himself as our guide. “An’ now, I reckon we might as well
be a-startin’, ladies,” said he. “Wait, ma’am, I’ll help you down the
bank. It’s mighty steep right here, but there wasn’t no other place
nigh so good for hitchin’ the boat. You, Mose, you be back to-night at
six o’clock sharp for the ladies. D’ye understand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sah’, yes, sah’, su’ah,” and Moses clattered away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once settled in the boat, the scene changed. We seemed to have
entered the beginning of an indefinitely long arbor, covered with grapevines.
Of course, there were, in reality, no grapevines, but the willows
and the short, bushy trees which completely overhung the four-foot wide
channel in which our boat rode made the illusion perfect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is beautiful,” said the Spinster, as she watched the sunshine
glinting through the pale-green leaves, still dew-covered, and falling in
bright reflections on the face of the dark water beneath.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>“It’s fine!” I echoed; “but when do we enter the swamp, guide?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re in the swamp now, ma’am. It’ll be just like this for ten
miles, and then we’ll come to the lake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—why,” I almost stammered in my amazement, “I thought
the swamp was dark and gloomy, with moss hanging from tall, mournful
pine trees, and not a sound to be heard in the wilderness. If it’s like this,
with bird-calls and sunshine and bright green leaves, why do they call it
‘dismal’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Alphonso smiled at my eagerness. “There’s more to it than shows
just at first, ma’am,” he answered. “There are more sad stories about
this swamp than all the sunshine can make bright. In the first place this
channel we’re riding in right now was dug by chain-gangs of slaves.
They say the poor creatures died here in heaps from swamp fever. But
that didn’t make any difference to their owners. They was made to dig
right into the heart of the swamp to get at the juniper trees. You see
they are very valuable—the most valuable wood, I guess, that grows; and
they are only to be found here in this swamp. I’ll show you some of them
when we come to them. They are tall and slim and straight. No, we
shan’t get to any until we are a good bit farther along. I told you the
swamp was all alike, but I didn’t mean that exactly. There’s a good bit
of difference, the deeper in we get, though you might not notice the difference
unless I pointed it out. The trees will be larger and taller, and the
bird-calls will be different—more wild, like, and there’ll be owls and
herons to be seen, and maybe a stork or two. I hope on account o’ you
ladies we shan’t meet no bears, but you see I’ve brought my gun along.
There’s always a chance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was more interested in his story of the slave gangs than in the
bears. “Do you actually mean,” I asked, “that in former times slaves
dug this channel ten miles long to Lake Drummond?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am, that’s an actual fact; but they got some advantages
from it, too, for while they was digging they got to know the swamp
pretty well, and they discovered there was islands hidden away in the
center of the swamp, though miles distant from this channel. The slaves
kept their discovery to themselves, and later on fugitive slaves made use
of it. If they could only reach these islands they were safe from their
pursuers, and it’s said that children and even grandchildren of the first
runaways were born, and lived, and died on these islands.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>“I don’t see what they had to eat,” suggested the prosaic Spinster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t understand, ma’am. These islands are just as dry and
nice as any land about here, and the swamp soil is mighty rich, so of
course they could just grow anything they had a mind to. Of course they
were helped also by friendly slaves on the plantations ’round here, and
then they had their cattle and honey to help out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cattle and honey!” exclaimed the Spinster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, ma’am; and they’re here yet. I get all the honey maw and
I want to eat from the hives of wild bees here, and most of my beef comes
from here, too. Besides, many a quarter I’ve sold. There’s no better
eatin’ than the swamp cattle. But a cur’us thing about ’em is that their
horns is polished just like ivory. It comes from pickin’ up their livin’ in
the swamp and brushin’ constant against tree trunks and reeds and the
like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t see how they came here in the first place, and I don’t see
what they live on in the second place,” continued the Spinster, glancing
at the edges of the swamp on either side of our narrow channel, which
seemingly consisted only of masses of dead leaves, dank moss, and reeds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I suppose they was tame cattle in the first place that strayed
in here an’ then stayed an’ multiplied just as the slaves did. An’ as for
eatin’, you ain’t seen the swamp grass, ma’am; it’s mighty rich.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think it would be unhealthy here,” said I. “I
don’t see how those fugitive slaves flourished to the third generation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no; that’s the queer part of it. It ain’t unhealthy. Those
niggers who dug this ditch died of fever, but the swamp itself ain’t unhealthy.
On the contrary, the medical folks say it’s a good place for
consumptives, and that this swamp water you see here, just as brown as
coffee, is good for ’em to drink. There’s been some talk of puttin’ up a
hotel on the shore of Lake Drummond for a health resort, and cuttin’ a
channel wide enough for a steamboat to run regular, but I hope they won’t
get to it in my time. I can’t hope that the Swamp’ll last much longer,”
he continued, with a sigh. “You see how black and rich the ground is,
and if it was drained and cleared it would be mighty productive. Some
capitalists are already talking of doing that and dividing it off into farms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a plan that pleased the Spinster, and she kept our guide talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>on this and kindred topics until the sun, creeping on, stood directly
overhead, and it was noon, and we had reached the limit of our journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>We forgot our prosaic talk of so short a time before when we stood
on the shores of Lake Drummond. There lay the magic lake, boldly
gray, even in brightest sunshine. Waves which were born from the winds
of the wilderness lapped the pebbles at our feet. Although the sun shone
warm upon us, it could not overcome the feeling of awe-struck loneliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you notice,” said my companion softly, “that even the bird-calls
of the swamp have ceased?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I nodded without speaking. It seemed unfitting to break by words
the ghostlike silence that brooded over this water so far from the life and
ways of men.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later the guide joined us and brought us down from this
high plane by his unconcerned talk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” he said, “this lake’s just on the boundary line between North
Carolina and Virginia. We came through ten miles of Virginia swamp
this morning to get to it, and we’d have to pole through ten miles of North
Carolina swamp if we tried to get out through the other side across the
lake there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What sources feed Lake Drummond?” asked the Spinster, shaking
herself free from the abstraction that had preceded Alphonso’s entrance
upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody knows,” returned the guide, shaking his head. “Nobody
knows where it comes from nor where it goes. The black folks around
here say that the lake belongs to the devil and the scientific people say it’s
of volcanic origin. Perhaps that amounts to the same thing.” Then he
changed the subject by briskly demanding if we were ready for lunch.</p>

<p class='c009'>We ate our luncheon in the rough wooden house, which, with its
shake-down beds and pine board tables, served as quarters for the hunters
and scientists, sometimes for weeks at a time. Perhaps its limited accommodations
satisfied them. We should not have been contented.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were not sorry to find ourselves once more in our comfortable
boat and started on our homeward journey.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“I reckon we don’t get any bears this trip,” remarked Alphonso,
after we had progressed a considerable distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you often get them?” asked the Spinster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure, though it’s kind o’ between seasons for them now. They
ain’t out lookin’ after berries or honey. I might say that I bag ’em
mighty frequent,” he continued. “That is, when I’m hunting by myself.
When I’m guidin’ other folks they do more missin’ than hittin’, I’m
bound to say,” he added with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had heard the evening before that Alphonso was considered the
best shot in Nansemond County, so that we did not doubt his personal
prowess, but the humorous twinkle in his eye encouraged us to ask for
stories of the misadventures of other people, and we heard various seriocomic
tales of grave professors who could draw a trigger and yet miss a
bear within six feet of them, or let a bear-cub crawl away unhurt, not from
a sense of pity, but from absent-mindedness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t mind so much their missin’ of the game,” said Alphonso,
“as I do their wanderin’ off by themselves an’ gettin’ lost in this
’ere swamp. It takes me such a pile o’ walkin’ before I can round ’em up
again. I remember once I was fool enough to let a party of three go off
huntin’ by themselves. It took me two days before I found ’em again,
an’ I can tell you I was gettin’ mighty anxious. My! didn’t they enjoy
the wild-cow beefsteak I cooked for ’em that night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spun his yarns, we hoped to beguile Alphonso into a more personal
strain and get him to tell about his own life and his mother to whom
he had more than once alluded. Although evidently unwilling to do so,
he did tell us enough of his life so that we could piece together his story
and account for his opposing characteristics. It seemed that his mother
had been an heiress and a belle in the days before the war. She had
married a colonel who was killed in one of the first battles, and her only
child, Alphonso, had at the age of eleven been thrust out into the world
to gain a living for himself and his mother. This he had succeeded in
doing, but there had been no time for education—that is, for book-knowledge.
Chivalry of manner he had learned from his lady-mother. The
wiles of Cupid he had likewise shunned. As he told us, he was an “old
bach,” and lived alone with “maw,” and reckoned he’d continue so to do,
When we tried to gather more details of his life, he showed himself shy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>as well as modest, and parried our most skillful questions. His last evasion
led to an incident which proved much to our advantage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look-a-there,” he cried, not answering the Spinster’s last quiz.
“Do you see that owl, ma’am, perched on that dead branch in the top of
that pine tree? He’s the largest I’ve seen this year. Would you like
him? He’d make a mighty nice specimen in case you’re collectin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Spinster’s eye and mine met in consultation. The decision was
unanimous, and an instant later the guide’s unerring rifle rang out and the
owl was fluttering in the water dead. He was picked up and his plumage
smoothed, and he was carefully bestowed under one of the boat seats.
The small remaining portion of our journey was given up to talk about
our new possession and how he should ultimately be disposed of, and in
this manner our day with Alphonso, “the Lohengrin of the Swamp,” drew
to a close. We were met at the appointed time and place by fat Moses
with the springless carriage. Alphonso bade us a courteous adieu, again
leaning against his oar in the attitude of the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Moses drove us back to the station at a rapid pace, chuckling the
while at our owl which lay on the seat beside him and which he said
“looked just like de debbil.” We arrived at the station in time to procure
a box for our owl, and then boarding the train arrived safely in Norfolk
that night.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>EDITORIAL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c033'>Although the year now nearly ended has been one of extreme labor
on the part of the Editor, he feels a reasonable degree of pride in that his
efforts to produce a magazine worthy of being known as the successor of
Mrs. Lamb’s <span class='sc'>Magazine of American History</span>, have been recognized
as successful, by many of his subscribers. That the venture could be
financially profitable the first year, was not expected—yet the deficiency
is not large, and may even yet be extinguished by the receipt of a comparatively
small number of subscriptions before the New Year is upon us.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is not the Editor’s custom to make unlimited promises for a coming
year—he much prefers to let the performance of 1905 stand as a fair
sample of what may be expected in 1906, and promises only to improve
on it if he can. It is so obvious that the standard of a periodical depends
on the growth of its subscription list, that he alludes to it only to emphasize
the fact that an historical periodical is particularly so dependent, as advertising
receipts from such an one can never be large—advertisers as a
rule seeking only those of great circulation. Hence the need that all who
claim to be interested in our Nation’s history should prove that interest by
subscribing to this, the only monthly devoted to the subject and not confining
itself to any one section of the United States.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its value can also be enhanced by the receipt of queries or historical
items appropriate to its columns—and the Editor wishes such whether
from subscribers or those who may read it only in our public libraries.</p>

<p class='c009'>To those who have aided him by contributing MSS. during the
year, he returns his warmest thanks, appreciating fully that only by such
aid has it been possible to successfully conduct the publication.</p>

<p class='c009'>The irregularity in publishing the monthly parts, has been unavoidable—but
subscribers may rest assured that all possible will be done to
reduce this to a minimum. It has been as much of an annoyance to the
Editor as to his subscribers, but may be occasionally inevitable in the
absence of the usual “quantity of matter awaiting publication,” which
more fortunate editors have been known to mention to aspirants for literary
fame.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MINOR TOPICS<br> <span class='c012'>THE FATE OF THE PIGEONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>[The description of the vast flocks of the wild pigeons (<i>Ectopistes migratoria</i>), given in
Mr. Ryman’s article in the October <span class='sc'>Magazine</span>, makes the following article, from a recent
number of <cite>Forest and Stream</cite>, of timely interest. The Editor remembers that in 1892, when
he desired to give a game dinner in New York, he was unable to add these birds to his list,
although making application to dealers as far west as Minneapolis. The description of a
flight of pigeons, given by Audubon and Wilson in their works, is of remarkable value, as
showing the great change wrought in a comparatively short period of time by the increase
of population in the former haunts of these valuable birds.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c021'>Being old enough at the time to fully appreciate the grand sight of
the myriads of wild pigeons as they moved back and forth through
the Mississippi valley in the late seventies, it did not occur to the
writer when they suddenly disappeared that it meant they had done so
for all time.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the years pass and no satisfactory explanation has been advanced,
the subject fairly nettles the thoughtful lover of nature. Superficial
humane zealots as usual credit the trapshooters with wanton slaughter,
which is positively silly when it is remembered that a single flock, one of
a hundred that passed in a day, would supply pigeons for trapshooting
for several years. That disease exterminated them is not impossible, and
is by far more reasonable than the trap or net explanation, twenty-five or
more years of guessing having failed to locate or account for the birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suggestion here offered (for what it is worth), which was
brought about by a dream, may, if followed up, give a clew to the whereabouts
or fate of the birds which sportsmen of the last generation will
ever remember as the most graceful and skillful flyers known. The
dream above mentioned need not be given in detail, nor could it be at
this time; however, the writer dreamed of a pow-wow with a venerable
Indian who, when asked what had become of the pigeons, stated, to
quote him literally (as dreamed), that “Pigeon heap d——n fool, fly
in big water [meaning the Gulf of Mexico], no come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I am without any element of superstition, but this dream and Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>affirmation have haunted me for months. I have just returned from the
Gulf coast, where, strange as it may seem, the dream has in a measure
been confirmed as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>Having waded through a slough several times in quest of jack snipe,
which were there in large numbers, and having killed and bagged many,
I came to an inviting log near the edge of the swamp, which made a good
resting place for a tired shooter. While seated there making up my
mind whether I should quit shooting or go back after the snipe again,
an old negro driving an antiquated mule attached to a creaking, ramshackle
wagon with dished wheels, drove up. A few pieces of webbing,
some chains for traces, and a bridle and reins of common clothesline made
a perfectly harmonious outfit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whoa, Jake!” commanded the old man as he rolled up to my resting
place. “Good mo’nin’, sah. You all been spo’tin’ some dis mo’nin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I assured him I had bagged a lot of jacks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dun hear pow’ful lots o’ gun firin’ as I come along back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His aged and gray head was set with bright eyes, and his old face
beamed with good nature. I decided to do some of the questioning, so
I started in with an inquiry as to whether Jake, who stood within reach of
my seat on the log, had been or was a kicker. His owner assured me he
was gentle and “never was a fool mule.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long have you lived here, uncle?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t live here; I lives up dis road ’bout fo’ miles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but how long have you lived in Texas, or near the Gulf?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Lo’d! I dun always been here,” and, as if to emphasize
the statement, his old face wrinkled more than usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember the pigeons, years ago?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shore does, sah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What became of them?” I asked, recalling the dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whar you all come from to ast dis nigger such fool things! Of
cou’se I knows.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>“Well, I don’t,” I remarked; “but would like to very much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You never dun heard of de black fog and the ‘norther’ on dis
beach ’bout twenty-five years ago?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never have; but what has that to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beg your pa’don, sah, I guess you-all ain’t jokin’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I assured him I was not, and he began the story of the disappearance
of the pigeons something like this:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When me and Tom Clay was out huntin’ ’coons and bob cats one
day, de fog came so thick it was most pitch dark in dis woods, and we was
’fraid to go to the island where Mars Judge Tobin lived, and we was
workin’, and jes had to stay right dar in dat timber fo’ days and fo’
nights—coze we shore would git lost if we rowed de boat in dat fog.
Well, de second mo’nin’ along come de ‘norther’ an’ dun blowed dis
timber most to pieces, but not de fog. By an’ bye I hear a sound, I dun
heard befo’, pigeons was a-flyin’ over, and de sound kep’ up all dat day
till mos’ dark. Den dey come fallin’ thro’ de trees around us with their
wings busted, and heads busted, like they was plum crazy; an’ when dey
seen our fire dey fluttered into it and put it clean out. Yas, sah, dat’s
God’s truf, I dun tole you all. Next mo’nin’ all dat could fly started off
to’d the ocean, an’ the noise of more a-comin’ kep’ up all day till mos’
night. Dat noise was shore mighty bad, an’ we dun been ’bout scared to
death when de fog lifted, an’ we started fo’ home in de boat. Den we
was scared agin, fo’ de bay was mos’ covered with dead pigeons an’ blood
an’ feathers, an’ mos’ every kind of a fish was dar jes helpin’ hisself, an’
so thick we could jes row de boat. We dun busted right into a nest of
sharks feedin’ on pigeons, an’ one throwed his tail so hard he knocked
de oar out of de boat mos’ ten feet. Next mo’nin’ all the pigeons was
dun gone, excep’ on de beach was some washed up, an’ a pow’ful lot of
dead fish, little ones’ s’pose got killed in de rush for pigeons. I neber
did see a big flock since, an’ ain’t seen nary one fo’ yeahs now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you think they perished in the Gulf?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dun seen um, I knows I know it!” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Will some kind reader help me in this matter and interview some old
sea dog who may have met the unfortunate birds further out to sea, and
verify this negro’s story, and the characteristic statement that “pigeon
heap fool, fly in big water, and no come back,” of the visionary Indian?</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INDIAN LEGENDS: III.<br> <span class='c012'>THE LONE BUFFALO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c021'>Among the legends which the traveler frequently hears, while crossing
the prairies of the Far West, I remember one which accounts in
a most romantic manner for the origin of thunder. A summer storm
was sweeping over the land, and I had sought a temporary shelter in
the lodge of a Sioux or Dacotah Indian on the banks of the St. Peter’s
River. Vividly flashed the lightning, and an occasional peal of thunder
echoed through the firmament. While the storm continued my host and
his family paid but little attention to my comfort, for they were all evidently
stricken with terror. I endeavored to quell their fears, and for
that purpose asked them a variety of questions respecting their people, but
they only replied by repeating, in a dismal tone the name of the <i>Lone
Buffalo</i>. My curiosity was of course excited, and it may readily be
imagined that I did not resume my journey without obtaining an explanation
of the mystic words; and from him who first uttered them in the Sioux
lodge I subsequently obtained the following legend:</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a chief of the Sioux nation whose name was the Master
Bear. He was famous as a prophet and hunter, and was a particular
favorite with the Master of Life. In an evil hour he partook of the
white man’s fire-water, and in a fighting broil unfortunately took the life
of a brother chief. According to ancient custom blood was demanded
for blood, and when next the Master Bear went forth to hunt, he was
waylaid, shot through the heart with an arrow, and his body deposited in
front of his widow’s lodge. Bitterly did the woman bewail her misfortune,
now mutilating her body in the most heroic manner, and anon narrating
to her only son, a mere infant, the prominent events of her husband’s
life. Night came, and with her child lashed upon her back, the woman
erected a scaffold on the margin of a neighboring stream, and with none
to lend her a helping hand, enveloped the corpse in her more valuable
robes, and fastened it upon the scaffold. She completed her task just as
the day was breaking, when she returned to the lodge, and shutting herself
therein, spent the three following days without tasting food.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>During her retirement the widow had a dream in which she was
visited by the Master of Life. He endeavored to console her in her
sorrow, and for the reason that he had loved her husband, promised to
make her son a more famous warrior and medicine man than his father
had been. And what was more remarkable, this prophecy was to be
realized within the period of a few weeks. She told her story in the
village, and was laughed at for her credulity.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the following day, when the village boys were throwing the ball
upon the plain, a noble youth suddenly made his appearance among the
players, and eclipsed them all in the bounds he made, and the wildness of
his shouts. He was a stranger to all, but when the widow’s dream was
remembered, he was recognized as her son, and treated with respect.
But the youth was yet without a name, for his mother had told him that
he should win one for himself by his individual prowess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only a few days had elapsed, when it was rumored that a party of
Pawnees had overtaken and destroyed a Sioux hunter, when it was immediately
determined in council that a party of one hundred warriors
should start upon the war-path and revenge the injury. Another council
was held for the purpose of appointing a leader, when a young man suddenly
entered the ring and claimed the privilege of leading the way. His
authority was angrily questioned, but the stranger only replied by pointing
to the brilliant eagle’s feathers on his head, and by shaking from his
belt a large number of fresh Pawnee scalps. They remembered the
stranger boy, and acknowledged the supremacy of the stranger man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Night settled upon the prairie world, and the Sioux warriors started
upon the war-path. Morning dawned and a Pawnee village was in
ashes, and the bodies of many hundred men, women and children were left
upon the ground as food for the wolf and vulture. The Sioux warriors
returned to their own encampment when it was ascertained that the nameless
leader had taken more than twice as many scalps as his brother warriors.
Then it was that a feeling of jealousy arose, which was soon quieted,
however, by the news that the Crow Indians had stolen a number of
horses and many valuable furs from a Sioux hunter as he was returning
from the mountains. Another warlike expedition was planned, and as
before the nameless warrior took the lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was near his setting, and as the Sioux party looked down
upon a Crow village, which occupied the center of a charming valley, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Sioux chief commanded the attention of his braves and addressed them
in the following language:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am about to die, my brothers, and must speak my mind. To be
fortunate in war is your chief ambition and because I have been successful
you are unhappy. Is this right? Have you acted like men? I despise
you for your meanness and I intend to prove to you this night that I am
the bravest man in the nation. The task will cost me my life, but I am
anxious that my nature should be changed and I shall be satisfied. I intend
to enter the Crow village alone, but before departing, I have one
favor to request. If I succeed in destroying that village, and lose my
life, I want you, when I am dead, to cut off my head and protect it with
care. You must then kill one of the largest buffaloes in the country and
cut off his head. You must then bring his body and my head together,
and breathe upon them, when I shall be free to roam in the Spirit-land
at all times, and over our great prairie-land wherever I please. And
when your hearts are troubled with wickedness remember the <i>Lone
Buffalo</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The attack upon the Crow village was successful, but according to his
prophecy the <i>Lone Buffalo</i> received his death wound, and his brother
warriors remembered his parting request. The fate of the hero’s mother
is unknown, but the Indians believe that it is she who annually sends from
the Spirit-land the warm winds of spring, which cover the prairies with
grass for the sustenance of the Buffalo race. As to the <i>Lone Buffalo</i>, he
is never seen even by the most cunning hunter, excepting when the moon
is at its full. At such times he is invariably alone, cropping his food in
some remote part of the prairies; and whenever the heavens resound with
the moanings of the thunder, the red man banishes from his breast every
feeling of jealousy, for he believes it to be the warning voice of the <i>Lone
Buffalo</i>.</p>

(13th Mass.) regiment, Continental army; killed in the battle of Monmouth, June 28, 1778.</p>

<p class='c025'>The agreement between him and Sellon, executed at Crown Point, is a curious proof of

  <h3 class='c010'>ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF LINCOLN’S SPEECH ON THE FORMATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. No date, but delivered in 1859.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>[An extremely valuable Lincoln document, perhaps the best that was ever offered at
public sale. It was accompanied by a letter from Mrs. E. J. Grinsley of Springfield, Ill.,
dated April 10th, 1866, presenting the Speech to the Rev. E. P. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c025'>Mrs. Grinsley in her letter calls it “<i>part of an address</i>,” but it reads like a short but
complete speech.]</p>

<p class='c025'>The following is the text:</p>

<p class='c033'>Upon those men who are in sentiment opposed to the spread and
nationalization of slavery, rests the task of preventing it. The Republican
organization is the embodyment of that sentiment; though, as yet,
it by no means embraces all the individuals holding that sentiment. The
party is newly formed; and in forming, old party ties had to be broken,
and the attractions of party pride and influential leaders were wholly wanting—In
spite of old differences, prejudices, and animosities, its members
were drawn together by a permanent common danger—They formed
and manœuvered in the face of the disciplined enemy, and in the teeth of
all his persistent misrepresentations— Of course, they fell far short of
gathering in all their own—And yet, a year ago, they stood up, an army
over thirteen hundred thousand strong—That army is, to-day, <span class='fss'>THE BEST
HOPE OF THE NATION AND OF THE WORLD</span>— Their work is before

<p class='c014'>[Part of letter of Major Jamel McHenry, member of the Continental Congress, military
secretary to Washington, and afterwards Secretary of War, to General Greene. It is dated
at Ambler’s Plantation, (opposite James Island, Va.), July 8, 1781. It is not signed, but is
of great historical interest. He says:]</p>

<p class='c033'>On the 4th Instant, the Enemy evacuated Williamsburg, where some
Stores fell into our Hands, and retreated to this Place, under the Cannon
of their Shipping. Next Morning we advanced to Bird’s Tavern and a
Part of the Army took Post at Narrell’s Mills about nine Miles from the
British Camp.—The Sixth I detached an advanced Corps under Gen’l
Wayne, with a View of reconnoitering the Enemy’s Situation. Their
light Parties being drawn in, the Pickets which lay close to their Encampment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>were gallantly attacked by some Riflemen, whose Skill was employed
to great Effect, Having ascertained that Lord Cornwallis had sent off
his Baggage, under a proper Escort and posted his Army in an open Field
fortified by the Shipping, I returned to the Detachment which I found
more generally engaged. A Piece of Cannon had been attempted by the
Van Guard under Major Galvan, whose conduct deserves high Applause.
Upon this the whole British Army came out and advanced to the thin
Wood occupied by Gen’l Wayne. His Corps chiefly composed of Pennsylvanians,
and some light Infantry did not exceed eight hundred Men,
with three Field Pieces. But notwithstanding their Numbers at Sight of
the British Army, the Troops ran to the encounter, a short Skirmish ensued
with a close Warm and well directed firing, but as the Enemy’s Right
and Left, of Course greatly out flanked ours, I sent Gen’l Wayne Orders
to retire Half a Mile to where Colonels Vose and Barber’s light Infantry
Battalions had arrived by a rapid Move and where I ordered them to
form, In this Position they remained ’till some Hours after Sunset,
The Militia under Gen’l Lawson had been advanced and the Continentals
were at Narrel’s Mill, when the Enemy retreated in the Night to James
Island, which they also evacuated, crossing over to the South Side of the
River. Their Ground at this Place and the Island was successively occupied
by Gen’l Muhlenberg, many valuable Horses were left on their
Retreat. From every account the Enemy’s Loss has been very great and
much Pains taken to conceal it. Their Light Infantry the Brigade of
Guards and two British Regiments formed the first Line. The Remainder
of their Army, the Second, the Cavalry paraded, but did nothing.
By the enclosed Returns you will see what Part of General Wayne’s Detachment
Suffered most. The services rendered by the Officers make me
happy to think that although many were wounded, we have lost none.
Most of the Field Officers had their horses killed. The same accident to
every Horse of two Field Pieces made it impossible to move them unless
men had been sacrificed. But it is enough for the Glory of Gen’l Wayne,
and the Officers and Men he commanded, to have attacked the whole
British Army, with a reconnoitering Party only, close to their encampment,
and by this severe Skirmish hastened their Retreat over the River.

me to express my sense of your goodness, and to declare the sincere and

our country, enhances the happiness of the present hour, and gives the
most pleasing anticipation of progressive prosperity—</p>

must be enjoyed in a peculiar degree by the deserving citizens of
Georgia—a State no less distinguished by its services, than by its sufferings

which our free and equal government can dispense, and that the happiness
of its vicinity may reply to the best wishes of its inhabitants is my
sincere prayer.</p>
